## **What is QuArch?**
**QuArch** (Question Answering in Computer Architecture) is a specialized dataset designed to support AI-driven question answering in the domain of computer architecture and hardware. Built from the Archipedia corpusâ€”a comprehensive collection of research articles, technical papers, and insights spanning decadesâ€”QuArch consists of questions on a wide range of computer architecture topics, with answers derived from curated technical content.

**QuArch** provides structured datasets for both straightforward and complex questions in areas such as:
- **Processor Design**
- **Memory Systems**
- **Performance Optimization**

By tackling these technical topics, QuArch serves as a benchmark dataset, helping researchers build and evaluate AI models for accuracy and relevance in the computer architecture domain.

The **alpha release of QuArch v1.0** offers a foundation of question-answer pairs, designed to help advance natural language understanding in technical fields and bridge the gap between AI capabilities and specialized knowledge in computer hardware and architecture.

## **QuArch Embeddings**
QuArch provides a visualization of embeddings, which plot how questions and answers relate to one another. The dataset includes **total question distributions** as well as **correctness across models**. You can toggle between these two views using the buttons below.

### **ðŸ“Š Total Question Distribution**
Plots all questions from the dataset.
