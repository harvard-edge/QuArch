The complexity comes from the need to simultaneously process hundreds of filters and channels in the high-dimensional convolutions, which involve a significant amount of data movement. Although highly-parallel compute paradigms, such as SIMD/SIMT, effectively address the computation requirement to achieve high throughput, energy consumption still remains high as data movement can be more expensive than computation. Accordingly, finding a dataflow that supports parallel processing with minimal data movement cost is crucial to achieving energy-efficient CNN processing without compromising accuracy. In this paper, we present a novel dataflow, called row-stationary (RS), that minimizes data movement energy consumption on a spatial architecture. This is realized by exploiting local data reuse of filter weights and feature map pixels, i.e., activations, in the high-dimensional convolutions, and minimizing data movement of partial sum accumulations. Unlike dataflows used in existing designs, which only reduce certain types of data movement, the proposed RS dataflow can adapt to different CNN shape configurations and reduces all types of data movement through maximally utilizing the processing engine (PE) local storage, direct inter-PE communication and spatial parallelism. To evaluate the energy efficiency of the different dataflows, we propose an analysis framework that compares energy cost under the same hardware area and processing parallelism constraints. Experiments using the CNN configurations of AlexNet show that the proposed RS dataflow is more energy efficient than existing dataflows in both convolutional (1.4\u00d7 to 2.5\u00d7) and fully-connected layers (at least 1.3\u00d7 for batch size larger than 16).

The negative effects of DRAM refresh increase as DRAM device capacity increases. Existing DRAM devices refresh all cells at a rate determined by the leakiest cell in the device. However, most DRAM cells can retain data for significantly longer. Therefore, many of these refreshes are unnecessary. In this paper, we propose RAIDR (Retention-Aware Intelligent DRAM Refresh), a low-cost mechanism that can identify and skip unnecessary refreshes using knowledge of cell retention times. Our key idea is to group DRAM rows into retention time bins and apply a different refresh rate to each bin. As a result, rows containing leaky cells are refreshed as frequently as normal, while most rows are refreshed less frequently. RAIDR uses Bloom filters to efficiently implement retention time bins. RAIDR requires no modification to DRAM and minimal modification to the memory controller. In an 8-core system with 32 GB DRAM, RAIDR achieves a 74.6% refresh reduction, an average DRAM power reduction of 16.1%, and an average system performance improvement of 8.6% over existing systems, at a modest storage overhead of 1.25 KB in the memory controller.

We compare the performance of GraFBoost with 1 GB of DRAM against various state-of-the-art graph analytics software including FlashGraph, running on a 32-thread Xeon server with 128 GB of DRAM. We demonstrate that despite the relatively small amount of DRAM, GraFBoost achieves high performance with very large graphs no other system can handle, and rivals the performance of the fastest software platforms on sizes of graphs that existing platforms can handle.

The sort-reduce accelerator logs random update requests and then uses hardware-accelerated external sorting with interleaved reduction functions.

We propose Static RRIP (SRRIP) that is scan-resistant and Dynamic RRIP (DRRIP) that is both scan-resistant and thrash-resistant. Both RRIP policies require only 2-bits per cache block and easily integrate into existing LRU approximations found in modern processors. Our evaluations using PC games, multimedia, server and SPEC CPU2006 workloads on a single-core processor with a 2MB last-level cache (LLC) show that both SRRIP and DRRIP outperform LRU replacement on the throughput metric by an average of 4% and 10% respectively. Our evaluations with over 1000 multi-programmed workloads on a 4-core CMP with an 8MB shared LLC show that SRRIP and DRRIP outperform LRU replacement on the throughput metric by an average of 7% and 9% respectively. We also show that RRIP outperforms LFU, the state-of the art scan-resistant replacement algorithm to-date. For the cache configurations under study, RRIP requires 2X less hardware than LRU and 2.5X less hardware than LFU.

To show the applicability of this design, two very different machines at opposite ends of the architectural spectrum, the Imagine stream processor and the Hydra speculative multiprocessor, are mapped onto the Smart Memories computing substrate. Simulations of the mappings show that the Smart Memories architecture can successfully map these architectures with only modest performance degradation.

This paper proposes the Dead-Block Predictors (DBPs), trace-based predictors that accurately identify \u201cwhen\u201d an Ll data cache block becomes evictable or \u201cdead\u201d.

A DBCP enables effective data prefetching in a wide spectrum of pointer-intensive, integer, and floating-point applications. We use cycle-accurate simulation of an out-of-order superscalar processor and memory-intensive benchmarks to show that: (1) dead-block prediction enhances prefetching lookahead at least by an order of magnitude as compared to previous techniques, (2) a DBP can predict dead blocks on average with a coverage of 90% only mispredicting 4% of the time, (3) a DBCP offers an address prediction coverage of 86% only mispredicting 3% of the time, and (4) DBCPs improve performance by 62% on average and 282% at best in the benchmarks we studied.

As a result, it is crucial that power/performance tradeoffs be made more visible to chip architects and even compiler writers, in addition to circuit designers. Most existing power analysis tools achieve high accuracy by calculating power estimates for designs only after layout or floorplanning are complete. In addition to being available only late in the design process, such tools are often quite slow, which compounds the difficulty of running them for a large space of design possibilities. This paper presents Wattch, a framework for analyzing and optimizing microprocessor power dissipation at the architecture-level. Wattch is 1000X or more faster than existing layout-level power tools, and yet maintains accuracy within 10% of their estimates as verified using industry tools on leading-edge designs. This paper presents several validations of Wattch's accuracy. In addition, we present three examples that demonstrate how architects or compiler writers might use Wattch to evaluate power consumption in their design process. We see Wattch as a complement to existing lower-level tools; it allows architects to explore and cull the design space early on, using faster, higher-level tools.

Although large caches can significantly improve performance, they have the potential to increase power consumption. As feature sizes shrink, the dominant component of this power loss will be leakage. However, during a fixed period of time the activity in a cache is only centered on a small subset of the lines. This behavior can be exploited to cut the leakage power of large caches by putting the cold cache lines into a state preserving, low-power drowsy mode. Moving lines into and out of drowsy state incurs a slight performance loss. In this paper we investigate policies and circuit techniques for implementing drowsy caches. We show that with simple architectural techniques, about 80%-90% of the cache lines can be maintained in a drowsy state without affecting performance by more than 1%. According to our projections, in a 0.07um CMOS process, drowsy caches will be able to reduce the total energy (static and dynamic) consumed in the caches by 50%-75%.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nTo address the increasing susceptibility of commodity chip multiprocessors (CMPs) to transient faults, we propose Chiplevel Redundantly Threaded multiprocessor with Recovery (CRTR). CRTR extends the previously-proposed CRT for transient-fault detection in CMPs, and the previously-proposed SRTR for transient-fault recovery in SMT. All these schemes achieve fault tolerance by executing and comparing two copies, called leading and trailing threads, of a given application. Previous recovery schemes for SMT do not perform well on CMPs. In a CMP, the leading and trailing threads execute on different processors to achieve load balancing and reduce the probability of a fault corrupting both threads; whereas in an SMT, both threads execute on the same processor. The inter-processor communication required to compare the threads introduces latency and bandwidth problems not present in an SMT.To hide inter-processor latency, CRTR executes the leading thread ahead of the trailing thread by maintaining a long slack, enabled by asymmetric commit. CRTR commits the leading thread before checking and the trailing thread after checking, so that the trailing thread state may be used for recovery. Previous recovery schemes commit both threads after checking, making a long slack suboptimal. To tackle inter-processor bandwidth, CRTR not only increases the bandwidth supply by pipelining the communication paths, but also reduces the bandwidth demand. By reasoning that faults propagate through dependences, previously-proposed Dependence-Based Checking Elision (DBCE) exploits (true) register dependence chains so that only the value of the last instruction in a chain is checked. However, instructions that mask operand bits may mask faults and limit the use of dependence chains. We propose Death- and Dependence-Based Checking Elision (DDBCE), which chains a masking instruction only if the source operand of the instruction dies after the instruction. Register deaths ensure that masked faults do not corrupt later computation. Using SPEC2000, we show that CRTR incurs negligible performance loss compared to CRT for inter-processor (one-way) latency as high as 30 cycles, and that the bandwidth requirements of CRT and CRTR with DDBCE are 5.2 and 7.1 bytes/cycle, respectively.

Combined, the units and the data storage format result in a data-parallel architecture that maintains wide, aligned accesses to its memory hierarchy and that keeps its data lanes busy. By loosening the ineffectual computation identification criterion, CNV enables further performance and energy efficiency improvements, and more so if a loss in accuracy is acceptable. Experimental measurements over a set of state-of-the-art DNNs for image classification show that CNV improves performance over a state-of-the-art accelerator from 1.24x to 1.55x and by 1.37x on average without any loss in accuracy by removing zero-valued operand multiplications alone. While CNV incurs an area overhead of 4.49%, it improves overall EDP (Energy Delay Product) and ED2P (Energy Delay Squared Product) on average by 1.47x and 2.01x, respectively. The average performance improvements increase to 1.52x without any loss in accuracy with a broader ineffectual identification policy. Further improvements are demonstrated with a loss in accuracy.

In this paper we propose several ways to design a high-performance datacenter network whose power consumption is more proportional to the amount of traffic it is moving -- that is, we propose energy proportional datacenter networks.

We present an architecture for simultaneous multithreading that achieves three goals: (1) it minimizes the architectural impact on the conventional superscalar design, (2) it has minimal performance impact on a single thread executing alone, and (3) it achieves significant throughput gains when running multiple threads. Our simultaneous multithreading architecture achieves a throughput of 5.4 instructions per cycle, a 2.5-fold improvement over an unmodified superscalar with similar hardware resources. This speedup is enhanced by an advantage of multithreading previously unexploited in other architectures: the ability to favor for fetch and issue those threads most efficiently using the processor each cycle, thereby providing the \"best\" instructions to the processor. The following is a binary choice question (answer with YES or NO) about Hardware Design. If you minimize the architectural impact on a conventional superscalar design, does the throughput always decrease?\n\n### Response:\nNO</s>",

In this paper, we explore the design space of microprocessors implemented in such printing technologies - these printed microprocessors will be needed for battery-powered applications with requirements of low cost, conformality, and programmability. To enable this design space exploration, we first present the standard cell libraries for EGFET and CNT-TFT printed technologies - to the best of our knowledge, these are the first synthesis and physical design ready standard cell libraries for any low voltage printing technology. We then present an area, power, and delay characterization of several off-the-shelf low gate count microprocessors (Z80, light8080, ZPU, and openMSP430) in EGFET and CNT-TFT technologies. Our characterization shows that several printing applications can be feasibly targeted by battery-powered printed microprocessors. However, our results also show the need to significantly reduce area and power of such printed microprocessors. We perform a design space exploration of printed microprocessor architectures over multiple parameters - datawidths, pipeline depth, etc. We show that the best cores outperform pre-existing cores by at least one order of magnitude in terms of power and area. Finally, we show that printing-specific architectural and low-level optimizations further improve area and power characteristics of low voltage battery-compatible printed microprocessors. Program-specific ISA, for example, improves power, and area by up to 4.18x and 1.93x respectively.

Weight pruning reduces DNN model size and the computation by removing redundant weights. However, we implemented weight pruning for several popular networks on a variety of hardware platforms and observed surprising results. For many networks, the network sparsity caused by weight pruning will actually hurt the overall performance despite large reductions in the model size and required multiply-accumulate operations. Also, encoding the sparse format of pruned networks incurs additional storage space overhead. To overcome these challenges, we propose Scalpel that customizes DNN pruning to the underlying hardware by matching the pruned network structure to the data-parallel hardware organization. Scalpel consists of two techniques: SIMD-aware weight pruning and node pruning. For low-parallelism hardware (e.g., microcontroller), SIMD-aware weight pruning maintains weights in aligned fixed-size groups to fully utilize the SIMD units. For high-parallelism hardware (e.g., GPU), node pruning removes redundant nodes, not redundant weights, thereby reducing computation without sacrificing the dense matrix format. For hardware with moderate parallelism (e.g., desktop CPU), SIMD-aware weight pruning and node pruning are synergistically applied together.

Fully realizing the potential of acceleration in this domain requires understanding and leveraging algorithmic properties of DNNs. This paper builds upon the algorithmic insight that bitwidth of operations in DNNs can be reduced without compromising their classification accuracy. However, to prevent loss of accuracy, the bitwidth varies significantly across DNNs and it may even be adjusted for each layer individually. Thus, a fixed-bitwidth accelerator would either offer limited benefits to accommodate the worst-case bitwidth requirements, or inevitably lead to a degradation in final accuracy. To alleviate these deficiencies, this work introduces dynamic bit-level fusion/decomposition as a new dimension in the design of DNN accelerators. We explore this dimension by designing Bit Fusion, a bit-flexible accelerator, that constitutes an array of bit-level processing elements that dynamically fuse to match the bitwidth of individual DNN layers. This flexibility in the architecture enables minimizing the computation and the communication at the finest granularity possible with no loss in accuracy. We evaluate the benefits of Bit Fusion using eight real-world feed-forward and recurrent DNNs. The proposed microarchitecture is implemented in Verilog and synthesized in 45 nm technology. Using the synthesis results and cycle accurate simulation, we compare the benefits of Bit Fusion to two state-of-the-art DNN accelerators, Eyeriss and Stripes. In the same area, frequency, and process technology, Bit Fusion offers 3.9x speedup and 5.1x energy savings over Eyeriss. Compared to Stripes, Bit Fusion provides 2.6x speedup and 3.9x energy reduction at 45 nm node when Bit Fusion area and frequency are set to those of Stripes. Scaling to GPU technology node of 16 nm, Bit Fusion almost matches the performance of a 250-Watt Titan Xp, which uses 8-bit vector instructions, while Bit Fusion merely consumes 895 milliwatts of power.

Such attacks can be mitigated by randomizing the location of the lines in the cache. Our recent proposal, CEASER, makes cache randomization practical by accessing the cache using an encrypted address and periodically changing the encryption key. CEASER was analyzed with the state-of-the-art algorithm on forming eviction sets, and the analysis showed that CEASER with a Remap-Rate of 1% is sufficient to tolerate years of attack. In this paper, we present two new attacks that significantly push the state-of-the-art in forming eviction sets. Our first attack reduces the time required to form the eviction set from O(L2) to O(L), where L is the number of lines in the attack. This attack is 35x faster than the best-known attack and requires that the Remap-Rate of CEASER be increased to 35%. Our second attack exploits the replacement policy (we analyze LRU, RRIP, and Random) to form eviction set quickly and requires that the Remap-Rate of CEASER be increased to more than 100%, incurring impractical overheads. To improve the robustness of CEASER against these attacks in a practical manner, we propose Skewed-CEASER (CEASER-S), which divides the cache ways into multiple partitions and maps the cache line to be resident in a different set in each partition. This design significantly improves the robustness of CEASER, as the attacker must form an eviction set that can dislodge the line from multiple possible locations. We show that CEASER-S can tolerate years of attacks while retaining a Remap-Rate of 1%. CEASER-S incurs negligible slowdown (within 1%) and a storage overhead of less than 100 bytes for the newly added structures.

If one can accurately predict critical threads in a parallel program, then one can respond in a variety of ways. Possibilities include running the critical thread at a faster clock rate, performing load balancing techniques to offload work onto currently non-critical threads, or giving the critical thread more on-chip resources to execute faster. This paper proposes and evaluates simple but effective thread criticality predictors for parallel applications. We show that accurate predictors can be built using counters that are typically already available on-chip. Our predictor, based on memory hierarchy statistics, identifies thread criticality with an average accuracy of 93% across a range of architectures. We also demonstrate two applications of our predictor. First, we show how Intel's Threading Building Blocks (TBB) parallel runtime system can benefit from task stealing techniques that use our criticality predictor to reduce load imbalance. Using criticality prediction to guide TBB's task-stealing decisions improves performance by 13-32% for TBB-based PARSEC benchmarks running on a 32-core CMP. As a second application, criticality prediction guides dynamic energy optimizations in barrier-based applications.

Parallel patterns have emerged from recent research on parallel programming as powerful, high-level abstractions that can elegantly capture data locality, memory access patterns, and parallelism across a wide range of dense and sparse applications. We motivate Plasticine by first observing key application characteristics captured by parallel patterns that are amenable to hardware acceleration, such as hierarchical parallelism, data locality, memory access patterns, and control flow. Based on these observations, we architect Plasticine as a collection of Pattern Compute Units and Pattern Memory Units. Pattern Compute Units are multi-stage pipelines of reconfigurable SIMD functional units that can efficiently execute nested patterns.

One challenge with this transition is that harvested energy is insufficient for continuous operation. Unfortunately, existing programs fail miserably when executed intermittently. This paper presents Clank: lightweight architectural support for correct and efficient execution of long-running applications on harvested energy---without programmer intervention or extreme hardware modifications. Clank is a set of hardware buffers and memory-access monitors that dynamically maintain idempotency. Essentially, Clank dynamically decomposes program execution into a stream of restartable sub-executions connected via lightweight checkpoints. To validate Clank's ability to correctly stretch program execution across frequent, random power cycles, and to explore the associated hardware and software overheads, we implement Clank in Verilog, formally verify it, and then add it to an ARM Cortex M0+ processor which we use to run a set of 23 embedded systems benchmarks. Experiments show run-time overheads as low as 2.5%, with run-time overheads of 6% for a version of Clank that adds 1.7% hardware.

This paper presents Clank: lightweight architectural support for correct and efficient execution of long-running applications on harvested energy---without programmer intervention or extreme hardware modifications. Clank is a set of hardware buffers and memory-access monitors that dynamically maintain idempotency. Essentially, Clank dynamically decomposes program execution into a stream of restartable sub-executions connected via lightweight checkpoints. To validate Clank's ability to correctly stretch program execution across frequent, random power cycles, and to explore the associated hardware and software overheads, we implement Clank in Verilog, formally verify it, and then add it to an ARM Cortex M0+ processor which we use to run a set of 23 embedded systems benchmarks. Experiments show run-time overheads as low as 2.5%, with run-time overheads of 6% for a version of Clank that adds 1.7% hardware. Clank minimizes checkpoints so much that re-execution time becomes the dominate contributor to run-time overhead. The following is a binary choice question (answer with YES or NO) about Hardware Design. Is the following statement true: Hardware buffers can minimize re-execution time?\n\n### Response:\nYES</s>",

The growing demand for computationally expensive, state-of-the-art DNNs, coupled with diminishing performance gains of general-purpose architectures, has fueled an explosion of specialized Neural Processing Units (NPUs). NPUs for interactive services should satisfy two requirements: (1) execution of DNN models with low latency, high throughput, and high efficiency, and (2) flexibility to accommodate evolving state-of-the-art models (e.g., RNNs, CNNs, MLPs) without costly silicon updates. This paper describes the NPU architecture for Project Brainwave, a production-scale system for real-time AI. The Brainwave NPU achieves more than an order of magnitude improvement in latency and throughput over state-of-the-art GPUs on large RNNs at a batch size of 1. The NPU attains this performance using a single-threaded SIMD ISA paired with a distributed microarchitecture capable of dispatching over 7M operations from a single instruction. The spatially distributed microarchitecture, scaled up to 96,000 multiply-accumulate units, is supported by hierarchical instruction decoders and schedulers coupled with thousands of independently addressable high-bandwidth on-chip memories, and can transparently exploit many levels of fine-grain SIMD parallelism. When targeting an FPGA, microarchitectural parameters such as native datapaths and numerical precision can be \"synthesis specialized\" to models at compile time, enabling atypically high FPGA performance competitive with hardened NPUs. When running on an Intel Stratix 10 280 FPGA, the Brainwave NPU achieves performance ranging from ten to over thirty-five teraflops, with no batching, on large, memory-intensive RNNs.

The cost ofbuilding datacenter facilities capable of delivering a given power capacity tosuch a computer can rival the recurring energy consumption costs themselves.Therefore, there are strong economic incentives to operate facilities as closeas possible to maximum capacity, so that the non-recurring facility costs canbe best amortized. That is difficult to achieve in practice because ofuncertainties in equipment power ratings and because power consumption tends tovary significantly with the actual computing activity. Effective powerprovisioning strategies are needed to determine how much computing equipmentcan be safely and efficiently hosted within a given power budget. In this paper we present the aggregate power usage characteristics of largecollections of servers (up to 15 thousand) for different classes ofapplications over a period of approximately six months. Those observationsallow us to evaluate opportunities for maximizing the use of the deployed powercapacity of datacenters, and assess the risks of over-subscribing it. We findthat even in well-tuned applications there is a noticeable gap (7 - 16%)between achieved and theoretical aggregate peak power usage at the clusterlevel (thousands of servers). The gap grows to almost 40% in wholedatacenters. This headroom can be used to deploy additional compute equipmentwithin the same power budget with minimal risk of exceeding it. We use ourmodeling framework to estimate the potential of power management schemes toreduce peak power and energy usage. We find that the opportunities for powerand energy savings are significant, but greater at the cluster-level (thousandsof servers) than at the rack-level (tens). Finally we argue that systems needto be power efficient across the activity range, and not only at peakperformance levels.
