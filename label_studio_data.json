      "context": "Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are widely used in modern AI systems for their superior accuracy but at the cost of high computational complexity. The complexity comes from the need to simultaneously process hundreds of filters and channels in the high-dimensional convolutions, which involve a significant amount of data movement. Although highly-parallel compute paradigms, such as SIMD/SIMT, effectively address the computation requirement to achieve high throughput, energy consumption still remains high as data movement can be more expensive than computation. Accordingly, finding a dataflow that supports parallel processing with minimal data movement cost is crucial to achieving energy-efficient CNN processing without compromising accuracy. In this paper, we present a novel dataflow, called row-stationary (RS), that minimizes data movement energy consumption on a spatial architecture. This is realized by exploiting local data reuse of filter weights and feature map pixels, i.e., activations, in the high-dimensional convolutions, and minimizing data movement of partial sum accumulations. Unlike dataflows used in existing designs, which only reduce certain types of data movement, the proposed RS dataflow can adapt to different CNN shape configurations and reduces all types of data movement through maximally utilizing the processing engine (PE) local storage, direct inter-PE communication and spatial parallelism. To evaluate the energy efficiency of the different dataflows, we propose an analysis framework that compares energy cost under the same hardware area and processing parallelism constraints. Experiments using the CNN configurations of AlexNet show that the proposed RS dataflow is more energy efficient than existing dataflows in both convolutional (1.4\u00d7 to 2.5\u00d7) and fully-connected layers (at least 1.3\u00d7 for batch size larger than 16). The RS dataflow has also been demonstrated on a fabricated chip, which verifies our energy analysis.",

      "authors": "Yu-Hsin Chen, Joel Emer, and Vivienne Sze",
      "context": "Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are widely used in modern AI systems for their superior accuracy but at the cost of high computational complexity. The complexity comes from the need to simultaneously process hundreds of filters and channels in the high-dimensional convolutions, which involve a significant amount of data movement. Although highly-parallel compute paradigms, such as SIMD/SIMT, effectively address the computation requirement to achieve high throughput, energy consumption still remains high as data movement can be more expensive than computation. Accordingly, finding a dataflow that supports parallel processing with minimal data movement cost is crucial to achieving energy-efficient CNN processing without compromising accuracy. In this paper, we present a novel dataflow, called row-stationary (RS), that minimizes data movement energy consumption on a spatial architecture. This is realized by exploiting local data reuse of filter weights and feature map pixels, i.e., activations, in the high-dimensional convolutions, and minimizing data movement of partial sum accumulations. Unlike dataflows used in existing designs, which only reduce certain types of data movement, the proposed RS dataflow can adapt to different CNN shape configurations and reduces all types of data movement through maximally utilizing the processing engine (PE) local storage, direct inter-PE communication and spatial parallelism. To evaluate the energy efficiency of the different dataflows, we propose an analysis framework that compares energy cost under the same hardware area and processing parallelism constraints. Experiments using the CNN configurations of AlexNet show that the proposed RS dataflow is more energy efficient than existing dataflows in both convolutional (1.4\u00d7 to 2.5\u00d7) and fully-connected layers (at least 1.3\u00d7 for batch size larger than 16). The RS dataflow has also been demonstrated on a fabricated chip, which verifies our energy analysis.",

The complexity comes from the need to simultaneously process hundreds of filters and channels in the high-dimensional convolutions, which involve a significant amount of data movement. Although highly-parallel compute paradigms, such as SIMD/SIMT, effectively address the computation requirement to achieve high throughput, energy consumption still remains high as data movement can be more expensive than computation. Accordingly, finding a dataflow that supports parallel processing with minimal data movement cost is crucial to achieving energy-efficient CNN processing without compromising accuracy. In this paper, we present a novel dataflow, called row-stationary (RS), that minimizes data movement energy consumption on a spatial architecture. This is realized by exploiting local data reuse of filter weights and feature map pixels, i.e., activations, in the high-dimensional convolutions, and minimizing data movement of partial sum accumulations. Unlike dataflows used in existing designs, which only reduce certain types of data movement, the proposed RS dataflow can adapt to different CNN shape configurations and reduces all types of data movement through maximally utilizing the processing engine (PE) local storage, direct inter-PE communication and spatial parallelism. To evaluate the energy efficiency of the different dataflows, we propose an analysis framework that compares energy cost under the same hardware area and processing parallelism constraints. Experiments using the CNN configurations of AlexNet show that the proposed RS dataflow is more energy efficient than existing dataflows in both convolutional (1.4\u00d7 to 2.5\u00d7) and fully-connected layers (at least 1.3\u00d7 for batch size larger than 16). The RS dataflow has also been demonstrated on a fabricated chip, which verifies our energy analysis.",

      "context": "Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are widely used in modern AI systems for their superior accuracy but at the cost of high computational complexity. The complexity comes from the need to simultaneously process hundreds of filters and channels in the high-dimensional convolutions, which involve a significant amount of data movement. Although highly-parallel compute paradigms, such as SIMD/SIMT, effectively address the computation requirement to achieve high throughput, energy consumption still remains high as data movement can be more expensive than computation. Accordingly, finding a dataflow that supports parallel processing with minimal data movement cost is crucial to achieving energy-efficient CNN processing without compromising accuracy. In this paper, we present a novel dataflow, called row-stationary (RS), that minimizes data movement energy consumption on a spatial architecture. This is realized by exploiting local data reuse of filter weights and feature map pixels, i.e., activations, in the high-dimensional convolutions, and minimizing data movement of partial sum accumulations. Unlike dataflows used in existing designs, which only reduce certain types of data movement, the proposed RS dataflow can adapt to different CNN shape configurations and reduces all types of data movement through maximally utilizing the processing engine (PE) local storage, direct inter-PE communication and spatial parallelism. To evaluate the energy efficiency of the different dataflows, we propose an analysis framework that compares energy cost under the same hardware area and processing parallelism constraints. Experiments using the CNN configurations of AlexNet show that the proposed RS dataflow is more energy efficient than existing dataflows in both convolutional (1.4\u00d7 to 2.5\u00d7) and fully-connected layers (at least 1.3\u00d7 for batch size larger than 16). The RS dataflow has also been demonstrated on a fabricated chip, which verifies our energy analysis.",

      "authors": "Yu-Hsin Chen, Joel Emer, and Vivienne Sze",
      "context": "Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are widely used in modern AI systems for their superior accuracy but at the cost of high computational complexity. The complexity comes from the need to simultaneously process hundreds of filters and channels in the high-dimensional convolutions, which involve a significant amount of data movement. Although highly-parallel compute paradigms, such as SIMD/SIMT, effectively address the computation requirement to achieve high throughput, energy consumption still remains high as data movement can be more expensive than computation. Accordingly, finding a dataflow that supports parallel processing with minimal data movement cost is crucial to achieving energy-efficient CNN processing without compromising accuracy. In this paper, we present a novel dataflow, called row-stationary (RS), that minimizes data movement energy consumption on a spatial architecture. This is realized by exploiting local data reuse of filter weights and feature map pixels, i.e., activations, in the high-dimensional convolutions, and minimizing data movement of partial sum accumulations. Unlike dataflows used in existing designs, which only reduce certain types of data movement, the proposed RS dataflow can adapt to different CNN shape configurations and reduces all types of data movement through maximally utilizing the processing engine (PE) local storage, direct inter-PE communication and spatial parallelism. To evaluate the energy efficiency of the different dataflows, we propose an analysis framework that compares energy cost under the same hardware area and processing parallelism constraints. Experiments using the CNN configurations of AlexNet show that the proposed RS dataflow is more energy efficient than existing dataflows in both convolutional (1.4\u00d7 to 2.5\u00d7) and fully-connected layers (at least 1.3\u00d7 for batch size larger than 16). The RS dataflow has also been demonstrated on a fabricated chip, which verifies our energy analysis.",

      "context": "Dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) is the building block of modern main memory systems. DRAM cells must be periodically refreshed to prevent loss of data. These refresh operations waste energy and degrade system performance by interfering with memory accesses. The negative effects of DRAM refresh increase as DRAM device capacity increases. Existing DRAM devices refresh all cells at a rate determined by the leakiest cell in the device. However, most DRAM cells can retain data for significantly longer. Therefore, many of these refreshes are unnecessary. In this paper, we propose RAIDR (Retention-Aware Intelligent DRAM Refresh), a low-cost mechanism that can identify and skip unnecessary refreshes using knowledge of cell retention times. Our key idea is to group DRAM rows into retention time bins and apply a different refresh rate to each bin. As a result, rows containing leaky cells are refreshed as frequently as normal, while most rows are refreshed less frequently. RAIDR uses Bloom filters to efficiently implement retention time bins. RAIDR requires no modification to DRAM and minimal modification to the memory controller. In an 8-core system with 32 GB DRAM, RAIDR achieves a 74.6% refresh reduction, an average DRAM power reduction of 16.1%, and an average system performance improvement of 8.6% over existing systems, at a modest storage overhead of 1.25 KB in the memory controller. RAIDR's benefits are robust to variation in DRAM system configuration, and increase as memory capacity increases.",

      "answer": "A",
      "authors": "Jamie Liu, Ben Jaiyen, Richard Veras, and Onur Mutlu",
      "context": "Dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) is the building block of modern main memory systems. DRAM cells must be periodically refreshed to prevent loss of data. These refresh operations waste energy and degrade system performance by interfering with memory accesses. The negative effects of DRAM refresh increase as DRAM device capacity increases. Existing DRAM devices refresh all cells at a rate determined by the leakiest cell in the device. However, most DRAM cells can retain data for significantly longer. Therefore, many of these refreshes are unnecessary. In this paper, we propose RAIDR (Retention-Aware Intelligent DRAM Refresh), a low-cost mechanism that can identify and skip unnecessary refreshes using knowledge of cell retention times. Our key idea is to group DRAM rows into retention time bins and apply a different refresh rate to each bin. As a result, rows containing leaky cells are refreshed as frequently as normal, while most rows are refreshed less frequently. RAIDR uses Bloom filters to efficiently implement retention time bins. RAIDR requires no modification to DRAM and minimal modification to the memory controller. In an 8-core system with 32 GB DRAM, RAIDR achieves a 74.6% refresh reduction, an average DRAM power reduction of 16.1%, and an average system performance improvement of 8.6% over existing systems, at a modest storage overhead of 1.25 KB in the memory controller. RAIDR's benefits are robust to variation in DRAM system configuration, and increase as memory capacity increases.",

      "answer": "A",
      "authors": "Jamie Liu, Ben Jaiyen, Richard Veras, and Onur Mutlu",
      "context": "Dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) is the building block of modern main memory systems. DRAM cells must be periodically refreshed to prevent loss of data. These refresh operations waste energy and degrade system performance by interfering with memory accesses. The negative effects of DRAM refresh increase as DRAM device capacity increases. Existing DRAM devices refresh all cells at a rate determined by the leakiest cell in the device. However, most DRAM cells can retain data for significantly longer. Therefore, many of these refreshes are unnecessary. In this paper, we propose RAIDR (Retention-Aware Intelligent DRAM Refresh), a low-cost mechanism that can identify and skip unnecessary refreshes using knowledge of cell retention times. Our key idea is to group DRAM rows into retention time bins and apply a different refresh rate to each bin. As a result, rows containing leaky cells are refreshed as frequently as normal, while most rows are refreshed less frequently. RAIDR uses Bloom filters to efficiently implement retention time bins. RAIDR requires no modification to DRAM and minimal modification to the memory controller. In an 8-core system with 32 GB DRAM, RAIDR achieves a 74.6% refresh reduction, an average DRAM power reduction of 16.1%, and an average system performance improvement of 8.6% over existing systems, at a modest storage overhead of 1.25 KB in the memory controller. RAIDR's benefits are robust to variation in DRAM system configuration, and increase as memory capacity increases.",

      "answer": "B",
      "authors": "Jamie Liu, Ben Jaiyen, Richard Veras, and Onur Mutlu",
      "context": "Dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) is the building block of modern main memory systems. DRAM cells must be periodically refreshed to prevent loss of data. These refresh operations waste energy and degrade system performance by interfering with memory accesses. The negative effects of DRAM refresh increase as DRAM device capacity increases. Existing DRAM devices refresh all cells at a rate determined by the leakiest cell in the device. However, most DRAM cells can retain data for significantly longer. Therefore, many of these refreshes are unnecessary. In this paper, we propose RAIDR (Retention-Aware Intelligent DRAM Refresh), a low-cost mechanism that can identify and skip unnecessary refreshes using knowledge of cell retention times. Our key idea is to group DRAM rows into retention time bins and apply a different refresh rate to each bin. As a result, rows containing leaky cells are refreshed as frequently as normal, while most rows are refreshed less frequently. RAIDR uses Bloom filters to efficiently implement retention time bins. RAIDR requires no modification to DRAM and minimal modification to the memory controller. In an 8-core system with 32 GB DRAM, RAIDR achieves a 74.6% refresh reduction, an average DRAM power reduction of 16.1%, and an average system performance improvement of 8.6% over existing systems, at a modest storage overhead of 1.25 KB in the memory controller. RAIDR's benefits are robust to variation in DRAM system configuration, and increase as memory capacity increases.",

      "context": "We describe GraFBoost, a flash-based architecture with hardware acceleration for external analytics of multi-terabyte graphs. We compare the performance of GraFBoost with 1 GB of DRAM against various state-of-the-art graph analytics software including FlashGraph, running on a 32-thread Xeon server with 128 GB of DRAM. We demonstrate that despite the relatively small amount of DRAM, GraFBoost achieves high performance with very large graphs no other system can handle, and rivals the performance of the fastest software platforms on sizes of graphs that existing platforms can handle. Unlike in-memory and semi-external systems, GraFBoost uses a constant amount of memory for all problems, and its performance decreases very slowly as graph sizes increase, allowing GraFBoost to scale to much larger problems than possible with existing systems while using much less resources on a single-node system. The key component of GraFBoost is the sort-reduce accelerator, which implements a novel method to sequentialize fine-grained random accesses to flash storage. The sort-reduce accelerator logs random update requests and then uses hardware-accelerated external sorting with interleaved reduction functions. GraFBoost also stores newly updated vertex values generated in each superstep of the algorithm lazily with the old vertex values to further reduce I/O traffic. We evaluate the performance of GraFBoost for PageRank, breadth-first search and betweenness centrality on our FPGA-based prototype (Xilinx VC707 with 1 GB DRAM and 1 TB flash) and compare it to other graph processing systems including a pure software implementation of GrapFBoost.",

      "authors": "Sang-Woo Jun, Andy Wright, Sizhuo Zhang, Shuotao Xu, and Arvind",
      "context": "We describe GraFBoost, a flash-based architecture with hardware acceleration for external analytics of multi-terabyte graphs. We compare the performance of GraFBoost with 1 GB of DRAM against various state-of-the-art graph analytics software including FlashGraph, running on a 32-thread Xeon server with 128 GB of DRAM. We demonstrate that despite the relatively small amount of DRAM, GraFBoost achieves high performance with very large graphs no other system can handle, and rivals the performance of the fastest software platforms on sizes of graphs that existing platforms can handle. Unlike in-memory and semi-external systems, GraFBoost uses a constant amount of memory for all problems, and its performance decreases very slowly as graph sizes increase, allowing GraFBoost to scale to much larger problems than possible with existing systems while using much less resources on a single-node system. The key component of GraFBoost is the sort-reduce accelerator, which implements a novel method to sequentialize fine-grained random accesses to flash storage. The sort-reduce accelerator logs random update requests and then uses hardware-accelerated external sorting with interleaved reduction functions. GraFBoost also stores newly updated vertex values generated in each superstep of the algorithm lazily with the old vertex values to further reduce I/O traffic. We evaluate the performance of GraFBoost for PageRank, breadth-first search and betweenness centrality on our FPGA-based prototype (Xilinx VC707 with 1 GB DRAM and 1 TB flash) and compare it to other graph processing systems including a pure software implementation of GrapFBoost.",

We compare the performance of GraFBoost with 1 GB of DRAM against various state-of-the-art graph analytics software including FlashGraph, running on a 32-thread Xeon server with 128 GB of DRAM. We demonstrate that despite the relatively small amount of DRAM, GraFBoost achieves high performance with very large graphs no other system can handle, and rivals the performance of the fastest software platforms on sizes of graphs that existing platforms can handle. Unlike in-memory and semi-external systems, GraFBoost uses a constant amount of memory for all problems, and its performance decreases very slowly as graph sizes increase, allowing GraFBoost to scale to much larger problems than possible with existing systems while using much less resources on a single-node system. The key component of GraFBoost is the sort-reduce accelerator, which implements a novel method to sequentialize fine-grained random accesses to flash storage. The sort-reduce accelerator logs random update requests and then uses hardware-accelerated external sorting with interleaved reduction functions. GraFBoost also stores newly updated vertex values generated in each superstep of the algorithm lazily with the old vertex values to further reduce I/O traffic.

      "answer": "A",
      "authors": "Sang-Woo Jun, Andy Wright, Sizhuo Zhang, Shuotao Xu, and Arvind",
      "context": "We describe GraFBoost, a flash-based architecture with hardware acceleration for external analytics of multi-terabyte graphs. We compare the performance of GraFBoost with 1 GB of DRAM against various state-of-the-art graph analytics software including FlashGraph, running on a 32-thread Xeon server with 128 GB of DRAM. We demonstrate that despite the relatively small amount of DRAM, GraFBoost achieves high performance with very large graphs no other system can handle, and rivals the performance of the fastest software platforms on sizes of graphs that existing platforms can handle. Unlike in-memory and semi-external systems, GraFBoost uses a constant amount of memory for all problems, and its performance decreases very slowly as graph sizes increase, allowing GraFBoost to scale to much larger problems than possible with existing systems while using much less resources on a single-node system. The key component of GraFBoost is the sort-reduce accelerator, which implements a novel method to sequentialize fine-grained random accesses to flash storage. The sort-reduce accelerator logs random update requests and then uses hardware-accelerated external sorting with interleaved reduction functions. GraFBoost also stores newly updated vertex values generated in each superstep of the algorithm lazily with the old vertex values to further reduce I/O traffic. We evaluate the performance of GraFBoost for PageRank, breadth-first search and betweenness centrality on our FPGA-based prototype (Xilinx VC707 with 1 GB DRAM and 1 TB flash) and compare it to other graph processing systems including a pure software implementation of GrapFBoost.",

      "context": "We describe GraFBoost, a flash-based architecture with hardware acceleration for external analytics of multi-terabyte graphs. We compare the performance of GraFBoost with 1 GB of DRAM against various state-of-the-art graph analytics software including FlashGraph, running on a 32-thread Xeon server with 128 GB of DRAM. We demonstrate that despite the relatively small amount of DRAM, GraFBoost achieves high performance with very large graphs no other system can handle, and rivals the performance of the fastest software platforms on sizes of graphs that existing platforms can handle. Unlike in-memory and semi-external systems, GraFBoost uses a constant amount of memory for all problems, and its performance decreases very slowly as graph sizes increase, allowing GraFBoost to scale to much larger problems than possible with existing systems while using much less resources on a single-node system. The key component of GraFBoost is the sort-reduce accelerator, which implements a novel method to sequentialize fine-grained random accesses to flash storage. The sort-reduce accelerator logs random update requests and then uses hardware-accelerated external sorting with interleaved reduction functions. GraFBoost also stores newly updated vertex values generated in each superstep of the algorithm lazily with the old vertex values to further reduce I/O traffic. We evaluate the performance of GraFBoost for PageRank, breadth-first search and betweenness centrality on our FPGA-based prototype (Xilinx VC707 with 1 GB DRAM and 1 TB flash) and compare it to other graph processing systems including a pure software implementation of GrapFBoost.",

      "context": "Branch prediction has enabled microprocessors to increase instruction level parallelism (ILP) by allowing programs to speculatively execute beyond control boundaries. Although speculative execution is essential for increasing the instructions per cycle (IPC), it does come at a cost. A large amount of unnecessary work results from wrong-path instructions entering the pipeline due to branch misprediction. Results generated with the SimpleScalar tool set using a 4-way issue pipeline and various branch predictors show an instruction overhead of 16% to 105% for event instruction committed. The instruction overhead will increase in the future as processors use more aggressive speculation and wider issue widths. In this paper we present an innovative method for power reduction ,which, unlike previous work that sacrificed flexibility or performance reduces power in high-performance microprocessors without impacting performance. In particular we introduce a hardware mechanism called pipeline gating to control rampant speculation in the pipeline. We present inexpensive mechanisms for determining when a branch is likely to mispredict, and for stopping wrong-path instructions from entering the pipeline. Results show up to a 38% reduction in wrong-path instructions with a negligible performance loss (/spl ap/1%). Best of all, even in programs with a high branch prediction accuracy, performance does not noticeable degrade. Our analysis indicates that there is little risk in implementing this method in existing processors since it does not impact performance and can benefit energy reduction.",

      "context": "Branch prediction has enabled microprocessors to increase instruction level parallelism (ILP) by allowing programs to speculatively execute beyond control boundaries. Although speculative execution is essential for increasing the instructions per cycle (IPC), it does come at a cost. A large amount of unnecessary work results from wrong-path instructions entering the pipeline due to branch misprediction. Results generated with the SimpleScalar tool set using a 4-way issue pipeline and various branch predictors show an instruction overhead of 16% to 105% for event instruction committed. The instruction overhead will increase in the future as processors use more aggressive speculation and wider issue widths. In this paper we present an innovative method for power reduction ,which, unlike previous work that sacrificed flexibility or performance reduces power in high-performance microprocessors without impacting performance. In particular we introduce a hardware mechanism called pipeline gating to control rampant speculation in the pipeline. We present inexpensive mechanisms for determining when a branch is likely to mispredict, and for stopping wrong-path instructions from entering the pipeline. Results show up to a 38% reduction in wrong-path instructions with a negligible performance loss (/spl ap/1%). Best of all, even in programs with a high branch prediction accuracy, performance does not noticeable degrade. Our analysis indicates that there is little risk in implementing this method in existing processors since it does not impact performance and can benefit energy reduction.",

      "context": "Branch prediction has enabled microprocessors to increase instruction level parallelism (ILP) by allowing programs to speculatively execute beyond control boundaries. Although speculative execution is essential for increasing the instructions per cycle (IPC), it does come at a cost. A large amount of unnecessary work results from wrong-path instructions entering the pipeline due to branch misprediction. Results generated with the SimpleScalar tool set using a 4-way issue pipeline and various branch predictors show an instruction overhead of 16% to 105% for event instruction committed. The instruction overhead will increase in the future as processors use more aggressive speculation and wider issue widths. In this paper we present an innovative method for power reduction ,which, unlike previous work that sacrificed flexibility or performance reduces power in high-performance microprocessors without impacting performance. In particular we introduce a hardware mechanism called pipeline gating to control rampant speculation in the pipeline. We present inexpensive mechanisms for determining when a branch is likely to mispredict, and for stopping wrong-path instructions from entering the pipeline. Results show up to a 38% reduction in wrong-path instructions with a negligible performance loss (/spl ap/1%). Best of all, even in programs with a high branch prediction accuracy, performance does not noticeable degrade. Our analysis indicates that there is little risk in implementing this method in existing processors since it does not impact performance and can benefit energy reduction.",

      "context": "Commercial applications such as databases and Web servers constitute the largest and fastest-growing segment of the market for multiprocessor servers. Ongoing innovations in disk subsystems, along with the ever increasing gap between processor and memory speeds, have elevated memory system design as the critical performance factor for such workloads. However, most current server designs have been optimized to perform well on scientific and engineering workloads, potentially leading to design decisions that are non-ideal for commercial applications. The above problem is exacerbated by the lack of information on the performance requirements of commercial workloads, the lack of available applications for widespread study, and the fact that most representative applications are too large and complex to serve as suitable benchmarks for evaluating trade-offs in the design of processors and servers.This paper presents a detailed performance study of three important classes of commercial workloads: online transaction processing (OLTP), decision support systems (DSS), and Web index search. We use the Oracle commercial database engine for our OLTP and DSS workloads, and the AltaVista search engine for our Web index search workload. This study characterizes the memory system behavior of these workloads through a large number of architectural experiments on Alpha multiprocessors augmented with full system simulations to determine the impact of architectural trends. We also identify a set of simplifications that make these workloads more amenable to monitoring and simulation without affecting representative memory system behavior. We observe that systems optimized for OLTP versus DSS and index search workloads may lead to diverging designs, specifically in the size and speed requirements for off-chip caches.",

      "context": "Commercial applications such as databases and Web servers constitute the largest and fastest-growing segment of the market for multiprocessor servers. Ongoing innovations in disk subsystems, along with the ever increasing gap between processor and memory speeds, have elevated memory system design as the critical performance factor for such workloads. However, most current server designs have been optimized to perform well on scientific and engineering workloads, potentially leading to design decisions that are non-ideal for commercial applications. The above problem is exacerbated by the lack of information on the performance requirements of commercial workloads, the lack of available applications for widespread study, and the fact that most representative applications are too large and complex to serve as suitable benchmarks for evaluating trade-offs in the design of processors and servers.This paper presents a detailed performance study of three important classes of commercial workloads: online transaction processing (OLTP), decision support systems (DSS), and Web index search. We use the Oracle commercial database engine for our OLTP and DSS workloads, and the AltaVista search engine for our Web index search workload. This study characterizes the memory system behavior of these workloads through a large number of architectural experiments on Alpha multiprocessors augmented with full system simulations to determine the impact of architectural trends. We also identify a set of simplifications that make these workloads more amenable to monitoring and simulation without affecting representative memory system behavior. We observe that systems optimized for OLTP versus DSS and index search workloads may lead to diverging designs, specifically in the size and speed requirements for off-chip caches.",

      "context": "Commercial applications such as databases and Web servers constitute the largest and fastest-growing segment of the market for multiprocessor servers. Ongoing innovations in disk subsystems, along with the ever increasing gap between processor and memory speeds, have elevated memory system design as the critical performance factor for such workloads. However, most current server designs have been optimized to perform well on scientific and engineering workloads, potentially leading to design decisions that are non-ideal for commercial applications. The above problem is exacerbated by the lack of information on the performance requirements of commercial workloads, the lack of available applications for widespread study, and the fact that most representative applications are too large and complex to serve as suitable benchmarks for evaluating trade-offs in the design of processors and servers.This paper presents a detailed performance study of three important classes of commercial workloads: online transaction processing (OLTP), decision support systems (DSS), and Web index search. We use the Oracle commercial database engine for our OLTP and DSS workloads, and the AltaVista search engine for our Web index search workload. This study characterizes the memory system behavior of these workloads through a large number of architectural experiments on Alpha multiprocessors augmented with full system simulations to determine the impact of architectural trends. We also identify a set of simplifications that make these workloads more amenable to monitoring and simulation without affecting representative memory system behavior. We observe that systems optimized for OLTP versus DSS and index search workloads may lead to diverging designs, specifically in the size and speed requirements for off-chip caches.",

      "context": "Commercial applications such as databases and Web servers constitute the largest and fastest-growing segment of the market for multiprocessor servers. Ongoing innovations in disk subsystems, along with the ever increasing gap between processor and memory speeds, have elevated memory system design as the critical performance factor for such workloads. However, most current server designs have been optimized to perform well on scientific and engineering workloads, potentially leading to design decisions that are non-ideal for commercial applications. The above problem is exacerbated by the lack of information on the performance requirements of commercial workloads, the lack of available applications for widespread study, and the fact that most representative applications are too large and complex to serve as suitable benchmarks for evaluating trade-offs in the design of processors and servers.This paper presents a detailed performance study of three important classes of commercial workloads: online transaction processing (OLTP), decision support systems (DSS), and Web index search. We use the Oracle commercial database engine for our OLTP and DSS workloads, and the AltaVista search engine for our Web index search workload. This study characterizes the memory system behavior of these workloads through a large number of architectural experiments on Alpha multiprocessors augmented with full system simulations to determine the impact of architectural trends. We also identify a set of simplifications that make these workloads more amenable to monitoring and simulation without affecting representative memory system behavior. We observe that systems optimized for OLTP versus DSS and index search workloads may lead to diverging designs, specifically in the size and speed requirements for off-chip caches.",

      "context": "Commercial applications such as databases and Web servers constitute the largest and fastest-growing segment of the market for multiprocessor servers. Ongoing innovations in disk subsystems, along with the ever increasing gap between processor and memory speeds, have elevated memory system design as the critical performance factor for such workloads. However, most current server designs have been optimized to perform well on scientific and engineering workloads, potentially leading to design decisions that are non-ideal for commercial applications. The above problem is exacerbated by the lack of information on the performance requirements of commercial workloads, the lack of available applications for widespread study, and the fact that most representative applications are too large and complex to serve as suitable benchmarks for evaluating trade-offs in the design of processors and servers.This paper presents a detailed performance study of three important classes of commercial workloads: online transaction processing (OLTP), decision support systems (DSS), and Web index search. We use the Oracle commercial database engine for our OLTP and DSS workloads, and the AltaVista search engine for our Web index search workload. This study characterizes the memory system behavior of these workloads through a large number of architectural experiments on Alpha multiprocessors augmented with full system simulations to determine the impact of architectural trends. We also identify a set of simplifications that make these workloads more amenable to monitoring and simulation without affecting representative memory system behavior. We observe that systems optimized for OLTP versus DSS and index search workloads may lead to diverging designs, specifically in the size and speed requirements for off-chip caches.",

Techniques to do in-situ arithmetic in SRAM arrays, create efficient data mapping and reducing data movement are proposed. The Neural Cache architecture is capable of fully executing convolutional, fully connected, and pooling layers in-cache. The proposed architecture also supports quantization in-cache. Our experimental results show that the proposed architecture can improve inference latency by 8.3\u00d7 over state-of-art multi-core CPU (Xeon E5), 7.7\u00d7 over server class GPU (Titan Xp), for Inception v3 model. Neural Cache improves inference throughput by 12.4\u00d7 over CPU (2.2\u00d7 over GPU), while reducing power consumption by 50% over CPU (53% over GPU).",

      "context": "This paper presents the Neural Cache architecture, which re-purposes cache structures to transform them into massively parallel compute units capable of running inferences for Deep Neural Networks. Techniques to do in-situ arithmetic in SRAM arrays, create efficient data mapping and reducing data movement are proposed. The Neural Cache architecture is capable of fully executing convolutional, fully connected, and pooling layers in-cache. The proposed architecture also supports quantization in-cache. Our experimental results show that the proposed architecture can improve inference latency by 8.3\u00d7 over state-of-art multi-core CPU (Xeon E5), 7.7\u00d7 over server class GPU (Titan Xp), for Inception v3 model. Neural Cache improves inference throughput by 12.4\u00d7 over CPU (2.2\u00d7 over GPU), while reducing power consumption by 50% over CPU (53% over GPU).",

Techniques to do in-situ arithmetic in SRAM arrays, create efficient data mapping and reducing data movement are proposed. The Neural Cache architecture is capable of fully executing convolutional, fully connected, and pooling layers in-cache. The proposed architecture also supports quantization in-cache. Our experimental results show that the proposed architecture can improve inference latency by 8.3\u00d7 over state-of-art multi-core CPU (Xeon E5), 7.7\u00d7 over server class GPU (Titan Xp), for Inception v3 model. Neural Cache improves inference throughput by 12.4\u00d7 over CPU (2.2\u00d7 over GPU), while reducing power consumption by 50% over CPU (53% over GPU).",

      "context": "Single-ISA heterogeneous multi-core processors are typically composed of small (e.g., in-order) power-efficient cores and big (e.g., out-of-order) high-performance cores. The effectiveness of heterogeneous multi-cores depends on how well a scheduler can map workloads onto the most appropriate core type. In general, small cores can achieve good performance if the workload inherently has high levels of ILP. On the other hand, big cores provide good performance if the workload exhibits high levels of MLP or requires the ILP to be extracted dynamically. This paper proposes Performance Impact Estimation (PIE) as a mechanism to predict which workload-to-core mapping is likely to provide the best performance. PIE collects CPI stack, MLP and ILP profile information, and estimates performance if the workload were to run on a different core type. Dynamic PIE adjusts the scheduling at runtime and thereby exploits fine-grained time-varying execution behavior. We show that PIE requires limited hardware support and can improve system performance by an average of 5.5% over recent state-of-the-art scheduling proposals and by 8.7% over a sampling-based scheduling policy.",

      "context": "Single-ISA heterogeneous multi-core processors are typically composed of small (e.g., in-order) power-efficient cores and big (e.g., out-of-order) high-performance cores. The effectiveness of heterogeneous multi-cores depends on how well a scheduler can map workloads onto the most appropriate core type. In general, small cores can achieve good performance if the workload inherently has high levels of ILP. On the other hand, big cores provide good performance if the workload exhibits high levels of MLP or requires the ILP to be extracted dynamically. This paper proposes Performance Impact Estimation (PIE) as a mechanism to predict which workload-to-core mapping is likely to provide the best performance. PIE collects CPI stack, MLP and ILP profile information, and estimates performance if the workload were to run on a different core type. Dynamic PIE adjusts the scheduling at runtime and thereby exploits fine-grained time-varying execution behavior. We show that PIE requires limited hardware support and can improve system performance by an average of 5.5% over recent state-of-the-art scheduling proposals and by 8.7% over a sampling-based scheduling policy.",

      "context": "Single-ISA heterogeneous multi-core processors are typically composed of small (e.g., in-order) power-efficient cores and big (e.g., out-of-order) high-performance cores. The effectiveness of heterogeneous multi-cores depends on how well a scheduler can map workloads onto the most appropriate core type. In general, small cores can achieve good performance if the workload inherently has high levels of ILP. On the other hand, big cores provide good performance if the workload exhibits high levels of MLP or requires the ILP to be extracted dynamically. This paper proposes Performance Impact Estimation (PIE) as a mechanism to predict which workload-to-core mapping is likely to provide the best performance. PIE collects CPI stack, MLP and ILP profile information, and estimates performance if the workload were to run on a different core type. Dynamic PIE adjusts the scheduling at runtime and thereby exploits fine-grained time-varying execution behavior. We show that PIE requires limited hardware support and can improve system performance by an average of 5.5% over recent state-of-the-art scheduling proposals and by 8.7% over a sampling-based scheduling policy.",

      "context": "Single-ISA heterogeneous multi-core processors are typically composed of small (e.g., in-order) power-efficient cores and big (e.g., out-of-order) high-performance cores. The effectiveness of heterogeneous multi-cores depends on how well a scheduler can map workloads onto the most appropriate core type. In general, small cores can achieve good performance if the workload inherently has high levels of ILP. On the other hand, big cores provide good performance if the workload exhibits high levels of MLP or requires the ILP to be extracted dynamically. This paper proposes Performance Impact Estimation (PIE) as a mechanism to predict which workload-to-core mapping is likely to provide the best performance. PIE collects CPI stack, MLP and ILP profile information, and estimates performance if the workload were to run on a different core type. Dynamic PIE adjusts the scheduling at runtime and thereby exploits fine-grained time-varying execution behavior. We show that PIE requires limited hardware support and can improve system performance by an average of 5.5% over recent state-of-the-art scheduling proposals and by 8.7% over a sampling-based scheduling policy.",

      "context": "GPU and FPGA-based clouds have already demonstrated the promise of accelerating computing-intensive workloads with greatly improved power and performance. In this paper, we examine the design of ASIC Clouds, which are purpose-built datacenters comprised of large arrays of ASIC accelerators, whose purpose is to optimize the total cost of ownership (TCO) of large, high-volume chronic computations, which are becoming increasingly common as more and more services are built around the Cloud model. On the surface, the creation of ASIC clouds may seem highlyimprobable due to high NREs and the inflexibility of ASICs. Surprisingly, however, large-scale ASIC Clouds have already been deployed by a large number of commercial entities, to implement the distributed Bitcoin cryptocurrency system. We begin with a case study of Bitcoin mining ASIC Clouds, which are perhaps the largest ASIC Clouds to date. From there, we design three more ASIC Clouds, including a YouTube-style video transcoding ASIC Cloud, a Litecoin ASIC Cloud, and a Convolutional Neural Network ASIC Cloud and show 2-3 orders of magnitude better TCO versus CPU and GPU. Among our contributions, we present a methodology that given an accelerator design, derives Pareto-optimal ASIC Cloud Servers, by extracting data from place-and-routed circuits and computational fluid dynamic simulations, and then employing clever but brute-force search to find the best jointly-optimized ASIC, DRAM subsystem, motherboard, power delivery system, cooling system, operating voltage, and case design. Moreover, we show how data center parameters determine which of the many Pareto-optimal points is TCO-optimal. Finally we examine when it makes sense to build an ASIC Cloud, and examine the impact of ASIC NRE.",

      "context": "GPU and FPGA-based clouds have already demonstrated the promise of accelerating computing-intensive workloads with greatly improved power and performance. In this paper, we examine the design of ASIC Clouds, which are purpose-built datacenters comprised of large arrays of ASIC accelerators, whose purpose is to optimize the total cost of ownership (TCO) of large, high-volume chronic computations, which are becoming increasingly common as more and more services are built around the Cloud model. On the surface, the creation of ASIC clouds may seem highlyimprobable due to high NREs and the inflexibility of ASICs. Surprisingly, however, large-scale ASIC Clouds have already been deployed by a large number of commercial entities, to implement the distributed Bitcoin cryptocurrency system. We begin with a case study of Bitcoin mining ASIC Clouds, which are perhaps the largest ASIC Clouds to date. From there, we design three more ASIC Clouds, including a YouTube-style video transcoding ASIC Cloud, a Litecoin ASIC Cloud, and a Convolutional Neural Network ASIC Cloud and show 2-3 orders of magnitude better TCO versus CPU and GPU. Among our contributions, we present a methodology that given an accelerator design, derives Pareto-optimal ASIC Cloud Servers, by extracting data from place-and-routed circuits and computational fluid dynamic simulations, and then employing clever but brute-force search to find the best jointly-optimized ASIC, DRAM subsystem, motherboard, power delivery system, cooling system, operating voltage, and case design. Moreover, we show how data center parameters determine which of the many Pareto-optimal points is TCO-optimal. Finally we examine when it makes sense to build an ASIC Cloud, and examine the impact of ASIC NRE.",

In this paper, we examine the design of ASIC Clouds, which are purpose-built datacenters comprised of large arrays of ASIC accelerators, whose purpose is to optimize the total cost of ownership (TCO) of large, high-volume chronic computations, which are becoming increasingly common as more and more services are built around the Cloud model. On the surface, the creation of ASIC clouds may seem highlyimprobable due to high NREs and the inflexibility of ASICs. Surprisingly, however, large-scale ASIC Clouds have already been deployed by a large number of commercial entities, to implement the distributed Bitcoin cryptocurrency system. We begin with a case study of Bitcoin mining ASIC Clouds, which are perhaps the largest ASIC Clouds to date. From there, we design three more ASIC Clouds, including a YouTube-style video transcoding ASIC Cloud, a Litecoin ASIC Cloud, and a Convolutional Neural Network ASIC Cloud and show 2-3 orders of magnitude better TCO versus CPU and GPU. Among our contributions, we present a methodology that given an accelerator design, derives Pareto-optimal ASIC Cloud Servers, by extracting data from place-and-routed circuits and computational fluid dynamic simulations, and then employing clever but brute-force search to find the best jointly-optimized ASIC, DRAM subsystem, motherboard, power delivery system, cooling system, operating voltage, and case design. Moreover, we show how data center parameters determine which of the many Pareto-optimal points is TCO-optimal. Finally we examine when it makes sense to build an ASIC Cloud, and examine the impact of ASIC NRE.",

      "context": "GPU and FPGA-based clouds have already demonstrated the promise of accelerating computing-intensive workloads with greatly improved power and performance. In this paper, we examine the design of ASIC Clouds, which are purpose-built datacenters comprised of large arrays of ASIC accelerators, whose purpose is to optimize the total cost of ownership (TCO) of large, high-volume chronic computations, which are becoming increasingly common as more and more services are built around the Cloud model. On the surface, the creation of ASIC clouds may seem highlyimprobable due to high NREs and the inflexibility of ASICs. Surprisingly, however, large-scale ASIC Clouds have already been deployed by a large number of commercial entities, to implement the distributed Bitcoin cryptocurrency system. We begin with a case study of Bitcoin mining ASIC Clouds, which are perhaps the largest ASIC Clouds to date. From there, we design three more ASIC Clouds, including a YouTube-style video transcoding ASIC Cloud, a Litecoin ASIC Cloud, and a Convolutional Neural Network ASIC Cloud and show 2-3 orders of magnitude better TCO versus CPU and GPU. Among our contributions, we present a methodology that given an accelerator design, derives Pareto-optimal ASIC Cloud Servers, by extracting data from place-and-routed circuits and computational fluid dynamic simulations, and then employing clever but brute-force search to find the best jointly-optimized ASIC, DRAM subsystem, motherboard, power delivery system, cooling system, operating voltage, and case design. Moreover, we show how data center parameters determine which of the many Pareto-optimal points is TCO-optimal. Finally we examine when it makes sense to build an ASIC Cloud, and examine the impact of ASIC NRE.",
      "question": "The feasibility of ASIC clouds for specific applications is primarily determined by:\nA) The current market price of Bitcoin, which drives demand for ASIC cloud infrastructure.\nB) The availability of pre-designed ASICs for common tasks like video transcoding and neural networks.\nC) The ease of integrating ASICs with existing data center infrastructure.\nD) The balance between the high NRE cost of ASIC design and the long-term operational cost savings for sufficiently high-volume computations.",

      "context": "Three-dimensional integration enables stacking memory directly on top of a microprocessor, thereby significantly reducing wire delay between the two. Previous studies have examined the performance benefits of such an approach, but all of these works only consider commodity 2D DRAM organizations. In this work, we explore more aggressive 3D DRAM organizations that make better use of the additional die-to-die bandwidth provided by 3D stacking, as well as the additional transistor count. Our simulation results show that with a few simple changes to the 3D-DRAM organization, we can achieve a 1.75x speedup over previously proposed 3D-DRAM approaches on our memory-intensive multi-programmed workloads on a quad-core processor. The significant increase in memory system performance makes the L2 miss handling architecture (MHA) a new bottleneck, which we address by combining a novel data structure called the Vector Bloom Filter with dynamic MSHR capacity tuning. Our scalable L2 MHA yields an additional 17.8% performance improvement over our 3D-stacked memory architecture.",

      "authors": "Gabriel H. Loh",
      "context": "Three-dimensional integration enables stacking memory directly on top of a microprocessor, thereby significantly reducing wire delay between the two. Previous studies have examined the performance benefits of such an approach, but all of these works only consider commodity 2D DRAM organizations. In this work, we explore more aggressive 3D DRAM organizations that make better use of the additional die-to-die bandwidth provided by 3D stacking, as well as the additional transistor count. Our simulation results show that with a few simple changes to the 3D-DRAM organization, we can achieve a 1.75x speedup over previously proposed 3D-DRAM approaches on our memory-intensive multi-programmed workloads on a quad-core processor. The significant increase in memory system performance makes the L2 miss handling architecture (MHA) a new bottleneck, which we address by combining a novel data structure called the Vector Bloom Filter with dynamic MSHR capacity tuning. Our scalable L2 MHA yields an additional 17.8% performance improvement over our 3D-stacked memory architecture.",

      "authors": "Gabriel H. Loh",
      "context": "Three-dimensional integration enables stacking memory directly on top of a microprocessor, thereby significantly reducing wire delay between the two. Previous studies have examined the performance benefits of such an approach, but all of these works only consider commodity 2D DRAM organizations. In this work, we explore more aggressive 3D DRAM organizations that make better use of the additional die-to-die bandwidth provided by 3D stacking, as well as the additional transistor count. Our simulation results show that with a few simple changes to the 3D-DRAM organization, we can achieve a 1.75x speedup over previously proposed 3D-DRAM approaches on our memory-intensive multi-programmed workloads on a quad-core processor. The significant increase in memory system performance makes the L2 miss handling architecture (MHA) a new bottleneck, which we address by combining a novel data structure called the Vector Bloom Filter with dynamic MSHR capacity tuning. Our scalable L2 MHA yields an additional 17.8% performance improvement over our 3D-stacked memory architecture.",

      "authors": "Gabriel H. Loh",
      "context": "Three-dimensional integration enables stacking memory directly on top of a microprocessor, thereby significantly reducing wire delay between the two. Previous studies have examined the performance benefits of such an approach, but all of these works only consider commodity 2D DRAM organizations. In this work, we explore more aggressive 3D DRAM organizations that make better use of the additional die-to-die bandwidth provided by 3D stacking, as well as the additional transistor count. Our simulation results show that with a few simple changes to the 3D-DRAM organization, we can achieve a 1.75x speedup over previously proposed 3D-DRAM approaches on our memory-intensive multi-programmed workloads on a quad-core processor. The significant increase in memory system performance makes the L2 miss handling architecture (MHA) a new bottleneck, which we address by combining a novel data structure called the Vector Bloom Filter with dynamic MSHR capacity tuning. Our scalable L2 MHA yields an additional 17.8% performance improvement over our 3D-stacked memory architecture.",

Still, both the energy efficiency and performance of such accelerators remain limited by memory accesses. In this paper, we focus on image applications, arguably the most important category among recognition and mining applications. The neural networks which are state-of-the-art for these applications are Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and they have an important property: weights are shared among many neurons, considerably reducing the neural network memory footprint. This property allows to entirely map a CNN within an SRAM, eliminating all DRAM accesses for weights. By further hoisting this accelerator next to the image sensor, it is possible to eliminate all remaining DRAM accesses, i.e., for inputs and outputs. In this paper, we propose such a CNN accelerator, placed next to a CMOS or CCD sensor. The absence of DRAM accesses combined with a careful exploitation of the specific data access patterns within CNNs allows us to design an accelerator which is 60&times more energy efficient than the previous state-of-the-art neural network accelerator. We present a full design down to the layout at 65 nm, with a modest footprint of 4.86mm2 and consuming only 320mW, but still about 30\u00d7 faster than high-end GPUs.",

Still, both the energy efficiency and performance of such accelerators remain limited by memory accesses. In this paper, we focus on image applications, arguably the most important category among recognition and mining applications. The neural networks which are state-of-the-art for these applications are Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and they have an important property: weights are shared among many neurons, considerably reducing the neural network memory footprint. This property allows to entirely map a CNN within an SRAM, eliminating all DRAM accesses for weights. By further hoisting this accelerator next to the image sensor, it is possible to eliminate all remaining DRAM accesses, i.e., for inputs and outputs. In this paper, we propose such a CNN accelerator, placed next to a CMOS or CCD sensor. The absence of DRAM accesses combined with a careful exploitation of the specific data access patterns within CNNs allows us to design an accelerator which is 60&times more energy efficient than the previous state-of-the-art neural network accelerator. We present a full design down to the layout at 65 nm, with a modest footprint of 4.86mm2 and consuming only 320mW, but still about 30\u00d7 faster than high-end GPUs.",

To aid such understanding, this paper presents a detailed microarchitectural analysis of live datacenter jobs, measured on more than 20,000 Google machines over a three year period, and comprising thousands of different applications. We first find that WSC workloads are extremely diverse, breeding the need for architectures that can tolerate application variability without performance loss. However, some patterns emerge, offering opportunities for co-optimization of hardware and software. For example, we identify common building blocks in the lower levels of the software stack. This \"datacenter tax\" can comprise nearly 30% of cycles across jobs running in the fleet, which makes its constituents prime candidates for hardware specialization in future server systems-on-chips. We also uncover opportunities for classic microarchitectural optimizations for server processors, especially in the cache hierarchy. Typical workloads place significant stress on instruction caches and prefer memory latency over bandwidth. They also stall cores often, but compute heavily in bursts. These observations motivate several interesting directions for future warehouse-scale computers.",

      "context": "With the increasing prevalence of warehouse-scale (WSC) and cloud computing, understanding the interactions of server applications with the underlying microarchitecture becomes ever more important in order to extract maximum performance out of server hardware. To aid such understanding, this paper presents a detailed microarchitectural analysis of live datacenter jobs, measured on more than 20,000 Google machines over a three year period, and comprising thousands of different applications. We first find that WSC workloads are extremely diverse, breeding the need for architectures that can tolerate application variability without performance loss. However, some patterns emerge, offering opportunities for co-optimization of hardware and software. For example, we identify common building blocks in the lower levels of the software stack. This \"datacenter tax\" can comprise nearly 30% of cycles across jobs running in the fleet, which makes its constituents prime candidates for hardware specialization in future server systems-on-chips. We also uncover opportunities for classic microarchitectural optimizations for server processors, especially in the cache hierarchy. Typical workloads place significant stress on instruction caches and prefer memory latency over bandwidth. They also stall cores often, but compute heavily in bursts. These observations motivate several interesting directions for future warehouse-scale computers.",
      "question": "The finding that warehouse-scale workloads exhibit frequent core stalls interspersed with bursts of computation suggests which microarchitectural optimization would be MOST beneficial?\nA) Larger register files to support more in-flight instructions during bursts.\nB) Increased branch predictor complexity to reduce stalls caused by mispredictions.\nC) Higher memory bandwidth to satisfy the demands of burst computations.\nD) Mechanisms to rapidly switch between active and stalled core states to conserve power.",

      "context": "Since 2005, processor designers have increased core counts to exploit Moore's Law scaling, rather than focusing on single-core performance. The failure of Dennard scaling, to which the shift to multicore parts is partially a response, may soon limit multicore scaling just as single-core scaling has been curtailed. This paper models multicore scaling limits by combining device scaling, single-core scaling, and multicore scaling to measure the speedup potential for a set of parallel workloads for the next five technology generations. For device scaling, we use both the ITRS projections and a set of more conservative device scaling parameters. To model single-core scaling, we combine measurements from over 150 processors to derive Pareto-optimal frontiers for area/performance and power/performance. Finally, to model multicore scaling, we build a detailed performance model of upper-bound performance and lower-bound core power. The multicore designs we study include single-threaded CPU-like and massively threaded GPU-like multicore chip organizations with symmetric, asymmetric, dynamic, and composed topologies. The study shows that regardless of chip organization and topology, multicore scaling is power limited to a degree not widely appreciated by the computing community. Even at 22 nm (just one year from now), 21% of a fixed-size chip must be powered off, and at 8 nm, this number grows to more than 50%. Through 2024, only 7.9\u00d7 average speedup is possible across commonly used parallel workloads, leaving a nearly 24-fold gap from a target of doubled performance per generation.",

The failure of Dennard scaling, to which the shift to multicore parts is partially a response, may soon limit multicore scaling just as single-core scaling has been curtailed. This paper models multicore scaling limits by combining device scaling, single-core scaling, and multicore scaling to measure the speedup potential for a set of parallel workloads for the next five technology generations. For device scaling, we use both the ITRS projections and a set of more conservative device scaling parameters. To model single-core scaling, we combine measurements from over 150 processors to derive Pareto-optimal frontiers for area/performance and power/performance. Finally, to model multicore scaling, we build a detailed performance model of upper-bound performance and lower-bound core power. The multicore designs we study include single-threaded CPU-like and massively threaded GPU-like multicore chip organizations with symmetric, asymmetric, dynamic, and composed topologies. The study shows that regardless of chip organization and topology, multicore scaling is power limited to a degree not widely appreciated by the computing community. Even at 22 nm (just one year from now), 21% of a fixed-size chip must be powered off, and at 8 nm, this number grows to more than 50%.

      "context": "Since 2005, processor designers have increased core counts to exploit Moore's Law scaling, rather than focusing on single-core performance. The failure of Dennard scaling, to which the shift to multicore parts is partially a response, may soon limit multicore scaling just as single-core scaling has been curtailed. This paper models multicore scaling limits by combining device scaling, single-core scaling, and multicore scaling to measure the speedup potential for a set of parallel workloads for the next five technology generations. For device scaling, we use both the ITRS projections and a set of more conservative device scaling parameters. To model single-core scaling, we combine measurements from over 150 processors to derive Pareto-optimal frontiers for area/performance and power/performance. Finally, to model multicore scaling, we build a detailed performance model of upper-bound performance and lower-bound core power. The multicore designs we study include single-threaded CPU-like and massively threaded GPU-like multicore chip organizations with symmetric, asymmetric, dynamic, and composed topologies. The study shows that regardless of chip organization and topology, multicore scaling is power limited to a degree not widely appreciated by the computing community. Even at 22 nm (just one year from now), 21% of a fixed-size chip must be powered off, and at 8 nm, this number grows to more than 50%. Through 2024, only 7.9\u00d7 average speedup is possible across commonly used parallel workloads, leaving a nearly 24-fold gap from a target of doubled performance per generation.",

      "context": "Evolving technology and increasing pin-bandwidth motivate the use of high-radix routers to reduce the diameter, latency, and cost of interconnection networks. High-radix networks, however, require longer cables than their low-radix counterparts. Because cables dominate network cost, the number of cables, and particularly the number of long, global cables should be minimized to realize an efficient network. In this paper, we introduce the dragonfly topology which uses a group of high-radix routers as a virtual router to increase the effective radix of the network. With this organization, each minimally routed packet traverses at most one global channel. By reducing global channels, a dragonfly reduces cost by 20% compared to a flattened butterfly and by 52% compared to a folded Clos network in configurations with \u2265 16K nodes.We also introduce two new variants of global adaptive routing that enable load-balanced routing in the dragonfly. Each router in a dragonfly must make an adaptive routing decision based on the state of a global channel connected to a different router. Because of the indirect nature of this routing decision, conventional adaptive routing algorithms give degraded performance. We introduce the use of selective virtual-channel discrimination and the use of credit round-trip latency to both sense and signal channel congestion. The combination of these two methods gives throughput and latency that approaches that of an ideal adaptive routing algorithm.",

      "context": "DRAM cells store data in the form of charge on a capacitor. This charge leaks off over time, eventually causing data to be lost. To prevent this data loss from occurring, DRAM cells must be periodically refreshed. Unfortunately, DRAM refresh operations waste energy and also degrade system performance by interfering with memory requests. These problems are expected to worsen as DRAM density increases. The amount of time that a DRAM cell can safely retain data without being refreshed is called the cell's retention time. In current systems, all DRAM cells are refreshed at the rate required to guarantee the integrity of the cell with the shortest retention time, resulting in unnecessary refreshes for cells with longer retention times. Prior work has proposed to reduce unnecessary refreshes by exploiting differences in retention time among DRAM cells; however, such mechanisms require knowledge of each cell's retention time. In this paper, we present a comprehensive quantitative study of retention behavior in modern DRAMs. Using a temperature-controlled FPGA-based testing platform, we collect retention time information from 248 commodity DDR3 DRAM chips from five major DRAM vendors. We observe two significant phenomena: data pattern dependence, where the retention time of each DRAM cell is significantly affected by the data stored in other DRAM cells, and variable retention time, where the retention time of some DRAM cells changes unpredictably over time. We discuss possible physical explanations for these phenomena, how their magnitude may be affected by DRAM technology scaling, and their ramifications for DRAM retention time profiling mechanisms.",
      "question": "The study's findings suggest that future DRAM refresh schemes will likely need to account for ____ to maximize efficiency.\nA) both data pattern dependence and variable retention time within individual DRAM cells\nB) solely the shortest retention time among all DRAM cells on a chip\nC) average retention time across all DRAM cells from a given vendor\nD) temperature variations across the DRAM module",

      "context": "Datacenter workloads demand high computational capabilities, flexibility, power efficiency, and low cost. It is challenging to improve all of these factors simultaneously. To advance datacenter capabilities beyond what commodity server designs can provide, we have designed and built a composable, reconfigurablefabric to accelerate portions of large-scale software services. Each instantiation of the fabric consists of a 6x8 2-D torus of high-end Stratix V FPGAs embedded into a half-rack of 48 machines. One FPGA is placed into each server, accessible through PCIe, and wired directly to other FPGAs with pairs of 10 Gb SAS cables. In this paper, we describe a medium-scale deployment of this fabric on a bed of 1,632 servers, and measure its efficacy in accelerating the Bing web search engine. We describe the requirements and architecture of the system, detail the critical engineering challenges and solutions needed to make the system robust in the presence of failures, and measure the performance, power, and resilience of the system when ranking candidate documents. Under high load, the largescale reconfigurable fabric improves the ranking throughput of each server by a factor of 95% for a fixed latency distribution--- or, while maintaining equivalent throughput, reduces the tail latency by 29%.",

      "context": "Datacenter workloads demand high computational capabilities, flexibility, power efficiency, and low cost. It is challenging to improve all of these factors simultaneously. To advance datacenter capabilities beyond what commodity server designs can provide, we have designed and built a composable, reconfigurablefabric to accelerate portions of large-scale software services. Each instantiation of the fabric consists of a 6x8 2-D torus of high-end Stratix V FPGAs embedded into a half-rack of 48 machines. One FPGA is placed into each server, accessible through PCIe, and wired directly to other FPGAs with pairs of 10 Gb SAS cables. In this paper, we describe a medium-scale deployment of this fabric on a bed of 1,632 servers, and measure its efficacy in accelerating the Bing web search engine. We describe the requirements and architecture of the system, detail the critical engineering challenges and solutions needed to make the system robust in the presence of failures, and measure the performance, power, and resilience of the system when ranking candidate documents. Under high load, the largescale reconfigurable fabric improves the ranking throughput of each server by a factor of 95% for a fixed latency distribution--- or, while maintaining equivalent throughput, reduces the tail latency by 29%.",
      "question": "When accelerating specific portions of a large application, rather than the entire application, a key design consideration is ____.\nA) ensuring the accelerated portions do not bottleneck the overall application performance.\nB) selecting portions of the application that are most computationally intensive.\nC) minimizing the communication overhead between the accelerated and non-accelerated portions.\nD) carefully analyzing the application to choose the portions whose acceleration provides the greatest overall benefit while managing added complexity.",

      "answer": "C",
      "authors": "Aamer Jaleel, Kevin B. Theobald, Simon C. Steely, and Joel Emer",
      "context": "Practical cache replacement policies attempt to emulate optimal replacement by predicting the re-reference interval of a cache block. The commonly used LRU replacement policy always predicts a near-immediate re-reference interval on cache hits and misses. Applications that exhibit a distant re-reference interval perform badly under LRU. Such applications usually have a working-set larger than the cache or have frequent bursts of references to non-temporal data (called scans). To improve the performance of such workloads, this paper proposes cache replacement using Re-reference Interval Prediction (RRIP). We propose Static RRIP (SRRIP) that is scan-resistant and Dynamic RRIP (DRRIP) that is both scan-resistant and thrash-resistant. Both RRIP policies require only 2-bits per cache block and easily integrate into existing LRU approximations found in modern processors. Our evaluations using PC games, multimedia, server and SPEC CPU2006 workloads on a single-core processor with a 2MB last-level cache (LLC) show that both SRRIP and DRRIP outperform LRU replacement on the throughput metric by an average of 4% and 10% respectively. Our evaluations with over 1000 multi-programmed workloads on a 4-core CMP with an 8MB shared LLC show that SRRIP and DRRIP outperform LRU replacement on the throughput metric by an average of 7% and 9% respectively. We also show that RRIP outperforms LFU, the state-of the art scan-resistant replacement algorithm to-date. For the cache configurations under study, RRIP requires 2X less hardware than LRU and 2.5X less hardware than LFU.",
      "question": "Applications with working sets larger than the cache size or those exhibiting frequent accesses to non-temporal data often experience performance degradation under traditional cache replacement policies like LRU because these policies ____.\nA) prioritize recently used data, potentially evicting data that will be needed soon.\nB) fail to adapt to changing access patterns, leading to unnecessary cache misses.\nC) implicitly assume short re-reference intervals, mispredicting the future reuse of data.\nD) increase the complexity of cache management, leading to higher hardware overhead.",

      "context": "Convolutional neural networks (CNN) applications range from recognition and reasoning (such as handwriting recognition, facial expression recognition and video surveillance) to intelligent text applications such as semantic text analysis and natural language processing applications. Two key observations drive the design of a new architecture for CNN. First, CNN workloads exhibit a widely varying mix of three types of parallelism: parallelism within a convolution operation, intra-output parallelism where multiple input sources (features) are combined to create a single output, and inter-output parallelism where multiple, independent outputs (features) are computed simultaneously. Workloads differ significantly across different CNN applications, and across different layers of a CNN. Second, the number of processing elements in an architecture continues to scale (as per Moore's law) much faster than off-chip memory bandwidth (or pin-count) of chips. Based on these two observations, we show that for a given number of processing elements and off-chip memory bandwidth, a new CNN hardware architecture that dynamically configures the hardware on-the-fly to match the specific mix of parallelism in a given workload gives the best throughput performance. Our CNN compiler automatically translates high abstraction network specification into a parallel microprogram (a sequence of low-level VLIW instructions) that is mapped, scheduled and executed by the coprocessor. Compared to a 2.3 GHz quad-core, dual socket Intel Xeon, 1.35 GHz C870 GPU, and a 200 MHz FPGA implementation, our 120 MHz dynamically configurable architecture is 4x to 8x faster. This is the first CNN architecture to achieve real-time video stream processing (25 to 30 frames per second) on a wide range of object detection and recognition tasks.",

      "context": "Convolutional neural networks (CNN) applications range from recognition and reasoning (such as handwriting recognition, facial expression recognition and video surveillance) to intelligent text applications such as semantic text analysis and natural language processing applications. Two key observations drive the design of a new architecture for CNN. First, CNN workloads exhibit a widely varying mix of three types of parallelism: parallelism within a convolution operation, intra-output parallelism where multiple input sources (features) are combined to create a single output, and inter-output parallelism where multiple, independent outputs (features) are computed simultaneously. Workloads differ significantly across different CNN applications, and across different layers of a CNN. Second, the number of processing elements in an architecture continues to scale (as per Moore's law) much faster than off-chip memory bandwidth (or pin-count) of chips. Based on these two observations, we show that for a given number of processing elements and off-chip memory bandwidth, a new CNN hardware architecture that dynamically configures the hardware on-the-fly to match the specific mix of parallelism in a given workload gives the best throughput performance. Our CNN compiler automatically translates high abstraction network specification into a parallel microprogram (a sequence of low-level VLIW instructions) that is mapped, scheduled and executed by the coprocessor. Compared to a 2.3 GHz quad-core, dual socket Intel Xeon, 1.35 GHz C870 GPU, and a 200 MHz FPGA implementation, our 120 MHz dynamically configurable architecture is 4x to 8x faster. This is the first CNN architecture to achieve real-time video stream processing (25 to 30 frames per second) on a wide range of object detection and recognition tasks.",
      "question": "Given the observation that processing element counts scale faster than off-chip memory bandwidth, which design principle becomes increasingly important for CNN accelerator architectures?\nA) Maximizing clock frequency to increase the number of operations per second.\nB) Optimizing data reuse and minimizing off-chip memory accesses.\nC) Employing a fixed architecture optimized for a specific type of CNN parallelism.\nD) Prioritizing the use of large on-chip caches to store entire CNN models.",

      "context": "Scale-out datacenters mandate high per-server throughput to get the maximum benefit from the large TCO investment. Emerging applications (e.g., data serving and web search) that run in these datacenters operate on vast datasets that are not accommodated by on-die caches of existing server chips. Large caches reduce the die area available for cores and lower performance through long access latency when instructions are fetched. Performance on scale-out workloads is maximized through a modestly-sized last-level cache that captures the instruction footprint at the lowest possible access latency. In this work, we introduce a methodology for designing scalable and efficient scale-out server processors. Based on a metric of performance-density, we facilitate the design of optimal multi-core configurations, called pods. Each pod is a complete server that tightly couples a number of cores to a small last-level cache using a fast interconnect. Replicating the pod to fill the die area yields processors which have optimal performance density, leading to maximum per-chip throughput. Moreover, as each pod is a stand-alone server, scale-out processors avoid the expense of global (i.e., inter-pod) interconnect and coherence. These features synergistically maximize throughput, lower design complexity, and improve technology scalability. In 20nm technology, scale-out chips improve throughput by 5x-6.5x over conventional and by 1.6x-1.9x over emerging tiled organizations.",

      "context": "Hardware specialization, in the form of accelerators that provide custom datapath and control for specific algorithms and applications, promises impressive performance and energy advantages compared to traditional architectures. Current research in accelerator analysis relies on RTL-based synthesis flows to produce accurate timing, power, and area estimates. Such techniques not only require significant effort and expertise but are also slow and tedious to use, making large design space exploration infeasible. To overcome this problem, we present Aladdin, a pre-RTL, power-performance accelerator modeling framework and demonstrate its application to system-on-chip (SoC) simulation. Aladdin estimates performance, power, and area of accelerators within 0.9%, 4.9%, and 6.6% with respect to RTL implementations. Integrated with architecture-level core and memory hierarchy simulators, Aladdin provides researchers an approach to model the power and performance of accelerators in an SoC environment.",

      "authors": "Hailong Yang, Alex Breslow, Jason Mars, and Lingjia Tang",
      "context": "Ensuring the quality of service (QoS) for latency-sensitive applications while allowing co-locations of multiple applications on servers is critical for improving server utilization and reducing cost in modern warehouse-scale computers (WSCs). Recent work relies on static profiling to precisely predict the QoS degradation that results from performance interference among co-running applications to increase the number of \"safe\" co-locations. However, these static profiling techniques have several critical limitations: 1) a priori knowledge of all workloads is required for profiling, 2) it is difficult for the prediction to capture or adapt to phase or load changes of applications, and 3) the prediction technique is limited to only two co-running applications. To address all of these limitations, we present Bubble-Flux, an integrated dynamic interference measurement and online QoS management mechanism to provide accurate QoS control and maximize server utilization. Bubble-Flux uses a Dynamic Bubble to probe servers in real time to measure the instantaneous pressure on the shared hardware resources and precisely predict how the QoS of a latency-sensitive job will be affected by potential co-runners. Once \"safe\" batch jobs are selected and mapped to a server, Bubble-Flux uses an Online Flux Engine to continuously monitor the QoS of the latency-sensitive application and control the execution of batch jobs to adapt to dynamic input, phase, and load changes to deliver satisfactory QoS. Batch applications remain in a state of flux throughout execution. Our results show that the utilization improvement achieved by Bubble-Flux is up to 2.2x better than the prior static approach.",

      "context": "In computer architecture, significant innovation frequently comes from industry. However, the simulation tools used by industry are often not released for open use, and even when they are, the exact details of industrial designs are not disclosed. As a result, research in the architecture space must ensure that assumptions about contemporary processor design remain true.To help bridge the gap between opaque industrial innovation and public research, we introduce three mechanisms that make it much easier for GPU simulators to keep up with industry. First, we introduce a new GPU simulator frontend that minimizes the effort required to simulate different machine ISAs through trace-driven simulation of NVIDIA's native machine ISA, while still supporting execution-driven simulation of the virtual ISA. Second, we extensively update GPGPU-Sim's performance model to increase its level of detail, configurability and accuracy. Finally, surrounding the new frontend and flexible performance model is an infrastructure that enables quick, detailed validation. A comprehensive set of microbenchmarks and automated correlation plotting ease the modeling process.We use these three new mechanisms to build Accel-Sim, a detailed simulation framework that decreases cycle error 79 percentage points, over a wide range of 80 workloads, consisting of 1,945 kernel instances. We further demonstrate that Accel-Sim is able to simulate benchmark suites that no other open-source simulator can. In particular, we use Accel-sim to simulate an additional 60 workloads, comprised of 11,440 kernel instances, from the machine learning benchmark suite Deepbench. Deepbench makes use of closed-source, hand-tuned kernels with no virtual ISA implementation. Using a rigorous counter-by-counter analysis, we validate Accel-Sim against contemporary GPUs.Finally, to highlight the effects of falling behind industry, this paper presents two case-studies that demonstrate how incorrect baseline assumptions can hide new areas of opportunity and lead to potentially incorrect design decisions.",

However, the simulation tools used by industry are often not released for open use, and even when they are, the exact details of industrial designs are not disclosed. As a result, research in the architecture space must ensure that assumptions about contemporary processor design remain true.To help bridge the gap between opaque industrial innovation and public research, we introduce three mechanisms that make it much easier for GPU simulators to keep up with industry. First, we introduce a new GPU simulator frontend that minimizes the effort required to simulate different machine ISAs through trace-driven simulation of NVIDIA's native machine ISA, while still supporting execution-driven simulation of the virtual ISA. Second, we extensively update GPGPU-Sim's performance model to increase its level of detail, configurability and accuracy. Finally, surrounding the new frontend and flexible performance model is an infrastructure that enables quick, detailed validation. A comprehensive set of microbenchmarks and automated correlation plotting ease the modeling process.We use these three new mechanisms to build Accel-Sim, a detailed simulation framework that decreases cycle error 79 percentage points, over a wide range of 80 workloads, consisting of 1,945 kernel instances. We further demonstrate that Accel-Sim is able to simulate benchmark suites that no other open-source simulator can. In particular, we use Accel-sim to simulate an additional 60 workloads, comprised of 11,440 kernel instances, from the machine learning benchmark suite Deepbench.

This paper introduces computer architects to DNA strand displacement \"circuits\", discusses associated architectural challenges, and proposes a new organization that provides practical composability. In particular, prior approaches rely mostly on stochastic interaction of freely diffusing components. This paper proposes practical spatial isolation of components, leading to more easily designed DNA-based circuits.

      "context": "The explosion of digital data and the ever-growing need for fast data analysis have made in-memory big-data processing in computer systems increasingly important. In particular, large-scale graph processing is gaining attention due to its broad applicability from social science to machine learning. However, scalable hardware design that can efficiently process large graphs in main memory is still an open problem. Ideally, cost-effective and scalable graph processing systems can be realized by building a system whose performance increases proportionally with the sizes of graphs that can be stored in the system, which is extremely challenging in conventional systems due to severe memory bandwidth limitations. In this work, we argue that the conventional concept of processing-in-memory (PIM) can be a viable solution to achieve such an objective. The key modern enabler for PIM is the recent advancement of the 3D integration technology that facilitates stacking logic and memory dies in a single package, which was not available when the PIM concept was originally examined. In order to take advantage of such a new technology to enable memory-capacity-proportional performance, we design a programmable PIM accelerator for large-scale graph processing called Tesseract. Tesseract is composed of (1) a new hardware architecture that fully utilizes the available memory bandwidth, (2) an efficient method of communication between different memory partitions, and (3) a programming interface that reflects and exploits the unique hardware design. It also includes two hardware prefetchers specialized for memory access patterns of graph processing, which operate based on the hints provided by our programming model. Our comprehensive evaluations using five state-of-the-art graph processing workloads with large real-world graphs show that the proposed architecture improves average system performance by a factor of ten and achieves 87% average energy reduction over conventional systems.",

      "context": "The explosion of digital data and the ever-growing need for fast data analysis have made in-memory big-data processing in computer systems increasingly important. In particular, large-scale graph processing is gaining attention due to its broad applicability from social science to machine learning. However, scalable hardware design that can efficiently process large graphs in main memory is still an open problem. Ideally, cost-effective and scalable graph processing systems can be realized by building a system whose performance increases proportionally with the sizes of graphs that can be stored in the system, which is extremely challenging in conventional systems due to severe memory bandwidth limitations. In this work, we argue that the conventional concept of processing-in-memory (PIM) can be a viable solution to achieve such an objective. The key modern enabler for PIM is the recent advancement of the 3D integration technology that facilitates stacking logic and memory dies in a single package, which was not available when the PIM concept was originally examined. In order to take advantage of such a new technology to enable memory-capacity-proportional performance, we design a programmable PIM accelerator for large-scale graph processing called Tesseract. Tesseract is composed of (1) a new hardware architecture that fully utilizes the available memory bandwidth, (2) an efficient method of communication between different memory partitions, and (3) a programming interface that reflects and exploits the unique hardware design. It also includes two hardware prefetchers specialized for memory access patterns of graph processing, which operate based on the hints provided by our programming model. Our comprehensive evaluations using five state-of-the-art graph processing workloads with large real-world graphs show that the proposed architecture improves average system performance by a factor of ten and achieves 87% average energy reduction over conventional systems.",

      "context": "With power density and hence cooling costs rising exponentially, processor packaging can no longer be designed for the worst case, and there is an urgent need for runtime processor-level techniques that can regulate operating temperature when the package's capacity is exceeded. Evaluating such techniques, however, requires a thermal model that is practical for architectural studies.This paper describes HotSpot, an accurate yet fast model based on an equivalent circuit of thermal resistances and capacitances that correspond to microarchitecture blocks and essential aspects of the thermal package. Validation was performed using finite-element simulation. The paper also introduces several effective methods for dynamic thermal management (DTM): \"temperature-tracking\" frequency scaling, localized toggling, and migrating computation to spare hardware units. Modeling temperature at the microarchitecture level also shows that power metrics are poor predictors of temperature, and that sensor imprecision has a substantial impact on the performance of DTM.",

      "context": "The bandwidth and latency of a memory system are strongly dependent on the manner in which accesses interact with the \u201c3-D\u201d structure of banks, rows, and columns characteristic of contemporary DRAM chips. There is nearly an order of magnitude difference in bandwidth between successive references to different columns within a row and different rows within a bank. This paper introduces memory access scheduling, a technique that improves the performance of a memory system by reordering memory references to exploit locality within the 3-D memory structure. Conservative reordering, in which the first ready reference in a sequence is performed, improves bandwidth by 40% for traces from five media benchmarks. Aggressive reordering, in which operations are scheduled to optimize memory bandwidth, improves bandwidth by 93% for the same set of applications. Memory access scheduling is particularly important for media processors where it enables the processor to make the most efficient use of scarce memory bandwidth.",

The modelalso provides insights into the workings of superscalarprocessors and long-term microarchitecture trends such aspipeline depths and issue widths.",

This paper proposes the Dead-Block Predictors (DBPs), trace-based predictors that accurately identify \u201cwhen\u201d an Ll data cache block becomes evictable or \u201cdead\u201d. Predicting a dead block significantly enhances prefetching lookahead and opportunity, and enables placing data directly into Ll, obviating the need for auxiliary prefetch buffers.

      "context": "Power dissipation and thermal issues are increasingly significant in modern processors. As a result, it is crucial that power/performance tradeoffs be made more visible to chip architects and even compiler writers, in addition to circuit designers. Most existing power analysis tools achieve high accuracy by calculating power estimates for designs only after layout or floorplanning are complete. In addition to being available only late in the design process, such tools are often quite slow, which compounds the difficulty of running them for a large space of design possibilities. This paper presents Wattch, a framework for analyzing and optimizing microprocessor power dissipation at the architecture-level. Wattch is 1000X or more faster than existing layout-level power tools, and yet maintains accuracy within 10% of their estimates as verified using industry tools on leading-edge designs. This paper presents several validations of Wattch's accuracy. In addition, we present three examples that demonstrate how architects or compiler writers might use Wattch to evaluate power consumption in their design process. We see Wattch as a complement to existing lower-level tools; it allows architects to explore and cull the design space early on, using faster, higher-level tools. It also opens up the field of power-efficient computing to a wider range of researchers by providing a power evaluation methodology within the portable and familiar SimpleScalar framework.",

A value prediction architecture produces values, which may be later consumed by instructions that execute speculatively using the predicted value. This paper examines selective techniques for using value prediction in the presence of predictor capacity constraints and reasonable misprediction penalties. We examine prediction and confidence mechanisms in light of these constraints, and we minimize capacity conflicts through instruction filtering. The latter technique filters which instructions put values into the value prediction table. We examine filtering techniques based on instruction type, as well as giving priority to instructions belonging to the longest data dependence path in the processor's active instruction window. We apply filtering both to the producers of predicted values and the consumers. In addition, we examine the benefit of using different confidence levels for instructions using predicted values on the longest dependence path.",

      "context": "Future computing workloads will emphasize an architecture's ability to perform relatively simple calculations on massive quantities of mixed-width data. This paper describes a novel reconfigurable fabric architecture, PipeRench, optimized to accelerate these types of computations. PipeRench enables fast, robust compilers, supports forward compatibility, and virtualizes configurations, thus removing the fixed size constraint present in other fabrics. For the first time we explore how the bit-width of processing elements affects performance and show how the PipeRench architecture has been optimized to balance the needs of the compiler against the realities of silicon. Finally, we demonstrate extreme performance speedup on certain computing kernels (up to 190x versus a modern RISC processor), and analyze how this acceleration translates to application speedup.",

We use detailed simulation of 12 benchmarks to study the effectiveness of current architectural features and identify future challenges for these workloads.

The memory behavior of our benchmarks is characterized by large working sets and streaming data accesses. Increasing the cache size has no impact on 8 of the benchmarks. The remaining benchmarks require relatively large cache sizes (dependent on the display sizes) to exploit data reuse, but derive less than 1.2 X performance benefits with the larger caches.

      "context": "One of the key challenges for high-density servers (e.g., blades) is the increased costs in addressing the power and heat density associated with compaction. Prior approaches have mainly focused on reducing the heat generated at the level of an individual server. In contrast, this work proposes power efficiencies at a larger scale by leveraging statistical properties of concurrent resource usage across a collection of systems (\"ensemble\"). Specifically, we discuss an implementation of this approach at the blade enclosure level to monitor and manage the power across the individual blades in a chassis. Our approach requires low-cost hardware modifications and relatively simple software support. We evaluate our architecture through both prototyping and simulation. For workloads representing 132 servers from nine different enterprise deployments, we show significant power budget reductions at performances comparable to conventional systems.",

      "context": "Transactional Memory (TM), Thread-Level Speculation (TLS), and Checkpointed multiprocessors are three popular architectural techniques based on the execution of multiple, cooperating speculative threads. In these environments, correctly maintaining data dependences across threads requires mechanisms for disambiguating addresses across threads, invalidating stale cache state, and making committed state visible. These mechanisms are both conceptually involved and hard to implement. In this paper, we present Bulk, a novel approach to simplify these mechanisms. The idea is to hash-encode a thread\u2019s access information in a concise signature, and then support in hardware signature operations that efficiently process sets of addresses. Such operations implement the mechanisms described. Bulk operations are inexact but correct, and provide substantial conceptual and implementation simplicity. We evaluate Bulk in the context of TLS using SPECint2000 codes and TM using multithreaded Java workloads. Despite its simplicity, Bulk has competitive performance with more complex schemes. We also find that signature configuration is a key design parameter.",

      "context": "In response to the growing gap between memory access time and processor speed, DRAM manufacturers have created several new DRAM architectures. This paper presents a simulation-based performance study of a representative group, each evaluated in a small system organization. These small-system organizations correspond to workstation-class computers and use on the order of 10 DRAM chips. The study covers Fast Page Mode, Extended Data Out, Synchronous, Enhanced Synchronous, Synchronous Link, Rambus, and Direct Rambus designs. Our simulations reveal several things: (a) current advanced DRAM technologies are attacking the memory bandwidth problem but not the latency problem; (b) bus transmission speed will soon become a primary factor limiting memory-system performance; (c) the post-L2 address stream still contains significant locality, though it varies from application to application; and (d) as we move to wider buses, row access time becomes more prominent, making it important to investigate techniques to exploit the available locality to decrease access time.",

      "context": "Significant time is spent by companies trying to reproduce and fix the bugs that occur for released code. To assist developers, we propose the BugNet architecture to continuously record information on production runs. The information collected before the crash of a program can be used by the developers working in their execution environment to deterministically replay the last several million instructions executed before the crash. BugNet is based on the insight that recording the register file contents at any point in time, and then recording the load values that occur after that point can enable deterministic replaying of a program's execution. BugNet focuses on being able to replay the application's execution and the libraries it uses, but not the operating system. But our approach provides the ability to replay an application's execution across context switches and interrupts. Hence, BugNet obviates the need for tracking program I/O, interrupts and DMA transfers, which would have otherwise required more complex hardware support. In addition, BugNet does not require a final core dump of the system state for replaying, which significantly reduces the amount of data that must be sent back to the developer.",

      "authors": "Satish Narayanasamy, Gilles Pokam, and Brad Calder",
      "context": "Significant time is spent by companies trying to reproduce and fix the bugs that occur for released code. To assist developers, we propose the BugNet architecture to continuously record information on production runs. The information collected before the crash of a program can be used by the developers working in their execution environment to deterministically replay the last several million instructions executed before the crash. BugNet is based on the insight that recording the register file contents at any point in time, and then recording the load values that occur after that point can enable deterministic replaying of a program's execution. BugNet focuses on being able to replay the application's execution and the libraries it uses, but not the operating system. But our approach provides the ability to replay an application's execution across context switches and interrupts. Hence, BugNet obviates the need for tracking program I/O, interrupts and DMA transfers, which would have otherwise required more complex hardware support. In addition, BugNet does not require a final core dump of the system state for replaying, which significantly reduces the amount of data that must be sent back to the developer.",

      "context": "This paper presents the Alpha EV8 conditional branch predictor The Alpha EV8 microprocessor project, canceled in June 2001 in a late phase of development, envisioned an aggressive 8-wide issue out-of-order superscalar microarchitecture featuring a very deep pipeline and simultaneous multithreading. Performance of such a processor is highly dependent on the accuracy of its branch predictor and consequently a very large silicon area was devoted to branch prediction on EV8. The Alpha EV8 branch predictor relies on global history and features a total of 352 Kbits.The focus of this paper is on the different trade-offs performed to overcome various implementation constraints for the EV8 branch predictor. One such instance is the pipelining of the predictor on two cycles to facilitate the prediction of up to 16 branches per cycle from any two dynamically successive, 8 instruction fetch blocks. This resulted in the use of three fetch-block old compressed branch history information for accesing the predictor. Implementation constraints also restricted the composition of the index functions for the predictor and forced the usage of only single-ported memory cells.Nevertheless, we show that the Alpha EV8 branch predictor achieves prediction accuracy in the same range as the state-of-the-art academic global history branch predictors that do not consider implementation constraints in great detail.",

      "authors": "Brian Fields, Shai Rubin, and Rastislav Bod\u00edk",
      "context": "Although some instructions hurt performance more than others, current processors typically apply scheduling and speculation as if each instruction was equally costly. Instruction cost can be naturally expressed through the critical path: if we could predict it at run-time, egalitarian policies could be replaced with cost-sensitive strategies that will grow increasingly effective as processors become more parallel. This paper introduces a hardware predictor of instruction criticality and uses it to improve performance. The predictor is both effective and simple in its hardware implementation. The effectiveness at improving performance stems from using a dependence-graph model of the microarchitectural critical path that identifies execution bottlenecks by incorporating both data and machine-specific dependences. The simplicity stems from a token-passing algorithm that computes the critical path without actually building the dependence graph. By focusing processor policies on critical instructions, our predictor enables a large class of optimizations. It can (i) give priority to critical instructions for scarce resources (functional units, ports, predictor entries); and (ii) suppress speculation on non-critical instructions, thus reducing \u201cuseless\u201d misspeculations. We present two case studies that illustrate the potential of the two types of optimization, we show that (i) critical-path-based dynamic instruction scheduling and steering in a clustered architecture improves performance by as much as 21% (10% on average); and (ii) focusing value prediction only on critical instructions improves performance by as much as 5%, due to removing nearly half of the misspeculations.",

      "context": "Although some instructions hurt performance more than others, current processors typically apply scheduling and speculation as if each instruction was equally costly. Instruction cost can be naturally expressed through the critical path: if we could predict it at run-time, egalitarian policies could be replaced with cost-sensitive strategies that will grow increasingly effective as processors become more parallel. This paper introduces a hardware predictor of instruction criticality and uses it to improve performance. The predictor is both effective and simple in its hardware implementation. The effectiveness at improving performance stems from using a dependence-graph model of the microarchitectural critical path that identifies execution bottlenecks by incorporating both data and machine-specific dependences. The simplicity stems from a token-passing algorithm that computes the critical path without actually building the dependence graph. By focusing processor policies on critical instructions, our predictor enables a large class of optimizations. It can (i) give priority to critical instructions for scarce resources (functional units, ports, predictor entries); and (ii) suppress speculation on non-critical instructions, thus reducing \u201cuseless\u201d misspeculations. We present two case studies that illustrate the potential of the two types of optimization, we show that (i) critical-path-based dynamic instruction scheduling and steering in a clustered architecture improves performance by as much as 21% (10% on average); and (ii) focusing value prediction only on critical instructions improves performance by as much as 5%, due to removing nearly half of the misspeculations.",

      "context": "In this paper, we propos a new shared memory model: Transactionalmemory Coherence and Consistency (TCC).TCC providesa model in which atomic transactions are always the basicunit of parallel work, communication, memory coherence, andmemory reference consistency.TCC greatly simplifies parallelsoftware by eliminating the need for synchronization using conventionallocks and semaphores, along with their complexities.TCC hardware must combine all writes from each transaction regionin a program into a single packet and broadcast this packetto the permanent shared memory state atomically as a large block.This simplifies the coherence hardware because it reduces theneed for small, low-latency messages and completely eliminatesthe need for conventional snoopy cache coherence protocols, asmultiple speculatively written versions of a cache line may safelycoexist within the system.Meanwhile, automatic, hardware-controlledrollback of speculative transactions resolves any correctnessviolations that may occur when several processors attemptto read and write the same data simultaneously.The cost of thissimplified scheme is higher interprocessor bandwidth.To explore the costs and benefits of TCC, we study the characterisitcsof an optimal transaction-based memory system, and examinehow different design parameters could affect the performanceof real systems.Across a spectrum of applications, the TCC modelitself did not limit available parallelism.Most applications areeasily divided into transactions requiring only small write buffers,on the order of 4-8 KB.The broadcast requirements of TCCare high, but are well within the capabilities of CMPs and small-scaleSMPs with high-speed interconnects.",

However, a novel application of RMT techniques in a dual-processor device, which we term chip-level redundant threading (CRT), shows higher performance than lockstepping the two cores, especially on multithreaded workloads.",

      "context": "In this paper, we consider tiled chip multiprocessors (CMP) where each tile contains a slice of the total on-chip L2 cache storage and tiles are connected by an on-chip network. The L2 slices can be managed using two basic schemes: 1) each slice is treated as a private L2 cache for the tile; 2) all slices are treated as a single large L2 cache shared by all tiles. Private L2 caches provide the lowest hit latency but reduce the total effective cache capacity, as each tile creates local copies of any line it touches. A shared L2 cache increases the effective cache capacity for shared data, but incurs long hit latencies when L2 data is on a remote tile. We present a new cache management policy, victim replication, which combines the advantages of private and shared schemes. Victim replication is a variant of the shared scheme which attempts to keep copies of local primary cache victims within the local L2 cache slice. Hits to these replicated copies reduce the effective latency of the shared L2 cache, while retaining the benefits of a higher effective capacity for shared data. We evaluate the various schemes using full-system simulation of both single-threaded and multi-threaded benchmarks running on an 8-processor tiled CMP. We show that victim replication reduces the average memory access latency of the shared L2 cache by an average of 16% for multi-threaded benchmarks and 24% for single-threaded benchmarks, providing better overall performance than either private or shared schemes.",

      "answer": "A",
      "authors": "Michael Zhang and Krste Asanovic",
      "context": "In this paper, we consider tiled chip multiprocessors (CMP) where each tile contains a slice of the total on-chip L2 cache storage and tiles are connected by an on-chip network. The L2 slices can be managed using two basic schemes: 1) each slice is treated as a private L2 cache for the tile; 2) all slices are treated as a single large L2 cache shared by all tiles. Private L2 caches provide the lowest hit latency but reduce the total effective cache capacity, as each tile creates local copies of any line it touches. A shared L2 cache increases the effective cache capacity for shared data, but incurs long hit latencies when L2 data is on a remote tile. We present a new cache management policy, victim replication, which combines the advantages of private and shared schemes. Victim replication is a variant of the shared scheme which attempts to keep copies of local primary cache victims within the local L2 cache slice. Hits to these replicated copies reduce the effective latency of the shared L2 cache, while retaining the benefits of a higher effective capacity for shared data. We evaluate the various schemes using full-system simulation of both single-threaded and multi-threaded benchmarks running on an 8-processor tiled CMP. We show that victim replication reduces the average memory access latency of the shared L2 cache by an average of 16% for multi-threaded benchmarks and 24% for single-threaded benchmarks, providing better overall performance than either private or shared schemes.",
      "question": "In a tiled CMP with a shared L2 cache, increased ____ often comes at the cost of higher hit latency.\nA) effective cache capacity for shared data\nB) inter-tile communication bandwidth\nC) complexity of cache coherence protocol\nD) power consumption of the on-chip network",

      "authors": "Rakesh Kumar, Victor V. Zyuban, and Dean M. Tullsen",
      "context": "This paper examines the area, power, performance, and design issues for the on-chip interconnects on a chip multiprocessor, attempting to present a comprehensive view of a class of interconnect architectures. It shows that the design choices for the interconnect have significant effect on the rest of the chip, potentially consuming a significant fraction of the real estate and power budget. This research shows that designs that treat interconnect as an entity that can be independently architected and optimized would not arrive at the best multi-core design. Several examples are presented showing the need for careful co-design. For instance, increasing interconnect bandwidth requires area that then constrains the number of cores or cache sizes, and does not necessarily increase performance. Also, shared level-2 caches become significantly less attractive when the overhead of the resulting crossbar is accounted for. A hierarchical bus structure is examined which negates some of the performance costs of the assumed base-line architecture.",
      "question": "Increasing the bandwidth of the on-chip interconnect in a multi-core processor ____.\nA) always leads to a proportional increase in overall system performance.\nB) has negligible impact on other chip resources like cache size or core count.\nC) is always beneficial, regardless of the architecture of other chip components.\nD) may negatively impact performance due to trade-offs with other on-chip resources.",

      "context": "On-chip caches represent a sizable fraction of the total power consumption of microprocessors. Although large caches can significantly improve performance, they have the potential to increase power consumption. As feature sizes shrink, the dominant component of this power loss will be leakage. However, during a fixed period of time the activity in a cache is only centered on a small subset of the lines. This behavior can be exploited to cut the leakage power of large caches by putting the cold cache lines into a state preserving, low-power drowsy mode. Moving lines into and out of drowsy state incurs a slight performance loss. In this paper we investigate policies and circuit techniques for implementing drowsy caches. We show that with simple architectural techniques, about 80%-90% of the cache lines can be maintained in a drowsy state without affecting performance by more than 1%. According to our projections, in a 0.07um CMOS process, drowsy caches will be able to reduce the total energy (static and dynamic) consumed in the caches by 50%-75%. We also argue that the use of drowsy caches can simplify the design and control of low-leakage caches, and avoid the need to completely turn off selected cache lines and lose their state.",

CRTR extends the previously-proposed CRT for transient-fault detection in CMPs, and the previously-proposed SRTR for transient-fault recovery in SMT. All these schemes achieve fault tolerance by executing and comparing two copies, called leading and trailing threads, of a given application. Previous recovery schemes for SMT do not perform well on CMPs. In a CMP, the leading and trailing threads execute on different processors to achieve load balancing and reduce the probability of a fault corrupting both threads; whereas in an SMT, both threads execute on the same processor. The inter-processor communication required to compare the threads introduces latency and bandwidth problems not present in an SMT.To hide inter-processor latency, CRTR executes the leading thread ahead of the trailing thread by maintaining a long slack, enabled by asymmetric commit. CRTR commits the leading thread before checking and the trailing thread after checking, so that the trailing thread state may be used for recovery. Previous recovery schemes commit both threads after checking, making a long slack suboptimal. To tackle inter-processor bandwidth, CRTR not only increases the bandwidth supply by pipelining the communication paths, but also reduces the bandwidth demand. By reasoning that faults propagate through dependences, previously-proposed Dependence-Based Checking Elision (DBCE) exploits (true) register dependence chains so that only the value of the last instruction in a chain is checked. However, instructions that mask operand bits may mask faults and limit the use of dependence chains. We propose Death- and Dependence-Based Checking Elision (DDBCE), which chains a masking instruction only if the source operand of the instruction dies after the instruction. Register deaths ensure that masked faults do not corrupt later computation. Using SPEC2000, we show that CRTR incurs negligible performance loss compared to CRT for inter-processor (one-way) latency as high as 30 cycles, and that the bandwidth requirements of CRT and CRTR with DDBCE are 5.2 and 7.1 bytes/cycle, respectively.",

      "context": "To address the increasing susceptibility of commodity chip multiprocessors (CMPs) to transient faults, we propose Chiplevel Redundantly Threaded multiprocessor with Recovery (CRTR). CRTR extends the previously-proposed CRT for transient-fault detection in CMPs, and the previously-proposed SRTR for transient-fault recovery in SMT. All these schemes achieve fault tolerance by executing and comparing two copies, called leading and trailing threads, of a given application. Previous recovery schemes for SMT do not perform well on CMPs. In a CMP, the leading and trailing threads execute on different processors to achieve load balancing and reduce the probability of a fault corrupting both threads; whereas in an SMT, both threads execute on the same processor. The inter-processor communication required to compare the threads introduces latency and bandwidth problems not present in an SMT.To hide inter-processor latency, CRTR executes the leading thread ahead of the trailing thread by maintaining a long slack, enabled by asymmetric commit. CRTR commits the leading thread before checking and the trailing thread after checking, so that the trailing thread state may be used for recovery. Previous recovery schemes commit both threads after checking, making a long slack suboptimal. To tackle inter-processor bandwidth, CRTR not only increases the bandwidth supply by pipelining the communication paths, but also reduces the bandwidth demand. By reasoning that faults propagate through dependences, previously-proposed Dependence-Based Checking Elision (DBCE) exploits (true) register dependence chains so that only the value of the last instruction in a chain is checked. However, instructions that mask operand bits may mask faults and limit the use of dependence chains. We propose Death- and Dependence-Based Checking Elision (DDBCE), which chains a masking instruction only if the source operand of the instruction dies after the instruction. Register deaths ensure that masked faults do not corrupt later computation. Using SPEC2000, we show that CRTR incurs negligible performance loss compared to CRT for inter-processor (one-way) latency as high as 30 cycles, and that the bandwidth requirements of CRT and CRTR with DDBCE are 5.2 and 7.1 bytes/cycle, respectively.",

      "context": "This paper evaluates the Raw microprocessor. Raw addresses thechallenge of building a general-purpose architecture that performswell on a larger class of stream and embedded computing applicationsthan existing microprocessors, while still running existingILP-based sequential programs with reasonable performance in theface of increasing wire delays. Raw approaches this challenge byimplementing plenty of on-chip resources - including logic, wires,and pins - in a tiled arrangement, and exposing them through a newISA, so that the software can take advantage of these resources forparallel applications. Raw supports both ILP and streams by routingoperands between architecturally-exposed functional units overa point-to-point scalar operand network. This network offers lowlatency for scalar data transport. Raw manages the effect of wiredelays by exposing the interconnect and using software to orchestrateboth scalar and stream data transport.We have implemented a prototype Raw microprocessor in IBM's180 nm, 6-layer copper, CMOS 7SF standard-cell ASIC process. Wehave also implemented ILP and stream compilers. Our evaluationattempts to determine the extent to which Raw succeeds in meetingits goal of serving as a more versatile, general-purpose processor.Central to achieving this goal is Raw's ability to exploit all formsof parallelism, including ILP, DLP, TLP, and Stream parallelism.Specifically, we evaluate the performance of Raw on a diverse setof codes including traditional sequential programs, streaming applications,server workloads and bit-level embedded computation.Our experimental methodology makes use of a cycle-accurate simulatorvalidated against our real hardware. Compared to a 180 nmPentium-III, using commodity PC memory system components, Rawperforms within a factor of 2x for sequential applications with a verylow degree of ILP, about 2x to 9x better for higher levels of ILP, and10x-100x better when highly parallel applications are coded in astream language or optimized by hand. The paper also proposes anew versatility metric and uses it to discuss the generality of Raw.",

      "context": "This paper evaluates the Raw microprocessor. Raw addresses thechallenge of building a general-purpose architecture that performswell on a larger class of stream and embedded computing applicationsthan existing microprocessors, while still running existingILP-based sequential programs with reasonable performance in theface of increasing wire delays. Raw approaches this challenge byimplementing plenty of on-chip resources - including logic, wires,and pins - in a tiled arrangement, and exposing them through a newISA, so that the software can take advantage of these resources forparallel applications. Raw supports both ILP and streams by routingoperands between architecturally-exposed functional units overa point-to-point scalar operand network. This network offers lowlatency for scalar data transport. Raw manages the effect of wiredelays by exposing the interconnect and using software to orchestrateboth scalar and stream data transport.We have implemented a prototype Raw microprocessor in IBM's180 nm, 6-layer copper, CMOS 7SF standard-cell ASIC process. Wehave also implemented ILP and stream compilers. Our evaluationattempts to determine the extent to which Raw succeeds in meetingits goal of serving as a more versatile, general-purpose processor.Central to achieving this goal is Raw's ability to exploit all formsof parallelism, including ILP, DLP, TLP, and Stream parallelism.Specifically, we evaluate the performance of Raw on a diverse setof codes including traditional sequential programs, streaming applications,server workloads and bit-level embedded computation.Our experimental methodology makes use of a cycle-accurate simulatorvalidated against our real hardware. Compared to a 180 nmPentium-III, using commodity PC memory system components, Rawperforms within a factor of 2x for sequential applications with a verylow degree of ILP, about 2x to 9x better for higher levels of ILP, and10x-100x better when highly parallel applications are coded in astream language or optimized by hand. The paper also proposes anew versatility metric and uses it to discuss the generality of Raw.",

      "context": "This paper describes the polymorphous TRIPS architecture which can be configured for different granularities and types of parallelism. TRIPS contains mechanisms that enable the processing cores and the on-chip memory system to be configured and combined in different modes for instruction, data, or thread-level parallelism. To adapt to small and large-grain concurrency, the TRIPS architecture contains four out-of-order, 16-wide-issue Grid Processor cores, which can be partitioned when easily extractable fine-grained parallelism exists. This approach to polymorphism provides better performance across a wide range of application types than an approach in which many small processors are aggregated to run workloads with irregular parallelism. Our results show that high performance can be obtained in each of the three modes--ILP, TLP, and DLP-demonstrating the viability of the polymorphous coarse-grained approach for future microprocessors.",

TRIPS contains mechanisms that enable the processing cores and the on-chip memory system to be configured and combined in different modes for instruction, data, or thread-level parallelism. To adapt to small and large-grain concurrency, the TRIPS architecture contains four out-of-order, 16-wide-issue Grid Processor cores, which can be partitioned when easily extractable fine-grained parallelism exists. This approach to polymorphism provides better performance across a wide range of application types than an approach in which many small processors are aggregated to run workloads with irregular parallelism. Our results show that high performance can be obtained in each of the three modes--ILP, TLP, and DLP-demonstrating the viability of the polymorphous coarse-grained approach for future microprocessors.",

      "context": "Ensuring long processor lifetimes by limiting failuresdue to wear-out related hard errors is a critical requirementfor all microprocessor manufacturers. We observethat continuous device scaling and increasing temperaturesare making lifetime reliability targets even harder to meet.However, current methodologies for qualifying lifetime reliabilityare overly conservative since they assume worst-caseoperating conditions. This paper makes the case thatthe continued use of such methodologies will significantlyand unnecessarily constrain performance. Instead, lifetimereliability awareness at the microarchitectural design stagecan mitigate this problem, by designing processors that dynamicallyadapt in response to the observed usage to meeta reliability target.We make two specific contributions. First, we describean architecture-level model and its implementation, calledRAMP, that can dynamically track lifetime reliability, respondingto changes in application behavior. RAMP isbased on state-of-the-art device models for different wear-outmechanisms. Second, we propose dynamic reliabilitymanagement (DRM) - a technique where the processorcan respond to changing application behavior to maintainits lifetime reliability target. In contrast to currentworst-case behavior based reliability qualification methodologies,DRM allows processors to be qualified for reliabilityat lower (but more likely) operating points than theworst case. Using RAMP, we show that this can save costand/or improve performance, that dynamic voltage scalingis an effective response technique for DRM, and that dynamicthermal management neither subsumes nor is sub-sumedby DRM.",

      "context": "Debuggers have been proven indispensable in improving software reliability. Unfortunately, on most real-life software, debuggers fail to deliver their most essential feature --- a faithful replay of the execution. The reason is non-determinism caused by multithreading and non-repeatable inputs. A common solution to faithful replay has been to record the non-deterministic execution. Existing recorders, however, either work only for datarace-free programs or have prohibitive overhead.As a step towards powerful debugging, we develop a practical low-overhead hardware recorder for cachecoherent multiprocessors, called Flight Data Recorder (FDR). Like an aircraft flight data recorder, FDR continuously records the execution, even on deployed systems, logging the execution for post-mortem analysis.FDR is practical because it piggybacks on the cache coherence hardware and logs nearly the minimal threadordering information necessary to faithfully replay the multiprocessor execution. Our studies, based on simulating a four-processor server with commercial workloads, show that when allocated less than 7% of system's physical memory, our FDR design can capture the last one second of the execution at modest (less than 2%) slowdown.",

      "context": "Debuggers have been proven indispensable in improving software reliability. Unfortunately, on most real-life software, debuggers fail to deliver their most essential feature --- a faithful replay of the execution. The reason is non-determinism caused by multithreading and non-repeatable inputs. A common solution to faithful replay has been to record the non-deterministic execution. Existing recorders, however, either work only for datarace-free programs or have prohibitive overhead.As a step towards powerful debugging, we develop a practical low-overhead hardware recorder for cachecoherent multiprocessors, called Flight Data Recorder (FDR). Like an aircraft flight data recorder, FDR continuously records the execution, even on deployed systems, logging the execution for post-mortem analysis.FDR is practical because it piggybacks on the cache coherence hardware and logs nearly the minimal threadordering information necessary to faithfully replay the multiprocessor execution. Our studies, based on simulating a four-processor server with commercial workloads, show that when allocated less than 7% of system's physical memory, our FDR design can capture the last one second of the execution at modest (less than 2%) slowdown.",

A promising solution to these problems is offered by an alternative to CMOS-based computing, chemically assembled electronic nanotechnology (CAEN). In this paper we outline how CAEN-based computing can become a reality. We briefly describe recent work in CAEN and how CAEN will affect computer architecture. We show how the inherently reconfigurable nature of CAEN devices can be exploited to provide high-density chips with defect tolerance at significantly reduced manufacturing costs. We develop a layered abstract architecture for CAEN-based computing devices and we present preliminary results which indicate that such devices will be competitive with CMOS circuits.",

      "answer": "A",
      "authors": "Stefanos Kaxiras, Zhigang Hu, and Margaret Martonosi",
      "context": "Power dissipation is increasingly important in CPUs ranging from those intended for mobile use, all the way up to high performance processors for high-end servers. While the bulk of the power dissipated is dynamic switching power leakage power is also beginning to be a concern. Chipmakers expect that in future chip generations, leakage's proportion of total chip power will increase significantly. This paper examines methods for reducing leakage power within the cache memories of the CPU. Because caches comprise much of a CPU chip's area and transistor counts, they are reasonable targets for attacking leakage. We discuss policies and implementations for reducing cache leakage by invalidating and \"turning off\" cache lines when they hold data not likely to be reused. In particular our approach is targeted at the generational nature of cache line usage. That is, cache lines typically have a flurry of frequent use when first brought into the cache, and then have a period of \"dead time\" before they are evicted. By devising effective, low-power ways of deducing dead time, our results show that in many cases we can reduce Ll cache leakage energy by 4/spl times/ in SPEC2000 applications without impacting performance. Because our decay-based techniques have notions of competitive on-line algorithms at their roots, their energy usage can be theoretically bounded at within a factor of two of the optimal oracle-based policy. We also examine adaptive decay-based policies that make energy-minimizing policy choices on a per-application basis by choosing appropriate decay intervals individually, for each cache line. Our proposed adaptive policies effectively reduce Ll cache leakage energy by 5/spl times/ for the SPEC2000 with only negligible degradations in performance.",
      "question": "The challenge with reducing cache leakage is largely due to the ____.\nA) temporal usage patterns of cache lines that involve phases of frequent use followed by dead time\nB) homogeneous nature of data held in caches\nC) uniform data access patterns across all applications\nD) continuous access and reuse of all cache lines",

      "context": "Power dissipation is increasingly important in CPUs ranging from those intended for mobile use, all the way up to high performance processors for high-end servers. While the bulk of the power dissipated is dynamic switching power leakage power is also beginning to be a concern. Chipmakers expect that in future chip generations, leakage's proportion of total chip power will increase significantly. This paper examines methods for reducing leakage power within the cache memories of the CPU. Because caches comprise much of a CPU chip's area and transistor counts, they are reasonable targets for attacking leakage. We discuss policies and implementations for reducing cache leakage by invalidating and \"turning off\" cache lines when they hold data not likely to be reused. In particular our approach is targeted at the generational nature of cache line usage. That is, cache lines typically have a flurry of frequent use when first brought into the cache, and then have a period of \"dead time\" before they are evicted. By devising effective, low-power ways of deducing dead time, our results show that in many cases we can reduce Ll cache leakage energy by 4/spl times/ in SPEC2000 applications without impacting performance. Because our decay-based techniques have notions of competitive on-line algorithms at their roots, their energy usage can be theoretically bounded at within a factor of two of the optimal oracle-based policy. We also examine adaptive decay-based policies that make energy-minimizing policy choices on a per-application basis by choosing appropriate decay intervals individually, for each cache line. Our proposed adaptive policies effectively reduce Ll cache leakage energy by 5/spl times/ for the SPEC2000 with only negligible degradations in performance.",

While the bulk of the power dissipated is dynamic switching power leakage power is also beginning to be a concern. Chipmakers expect that in future chip generations, leakage's proportion of total chip power will increase significantly. This paper examines methods for reducing leakage power within the cache memories of the CPU. Because caches comprise much of a CPU chip's area and transistor counts, they are reasonable targets for attacking leakage. We discuss policies and implementations for reducing cache leakage by invalidating and \"turning off\" cache lines when they hold data not likely to be reused. In particular our approach is targeted at the generational nature of cache line usage. That is, cache lines typically have a flurry of frequent use when first brought into the cache, and then have a period of \"dead time\" before they are evicted. By devising effective, low-power ways of deducing dead time, our results show that in many cases we can reduce Ll cache leakage energy by 4/spl times/ in SPEC2000 applications without impacting performance. Because our decay-based techniques have notions of competitive on-line algorithms at their roots, their energy usage can be theoretically bounded at within a factor of two of the optimal oracle-based policy. We also examine adaptive decay-based policies that make energy-minimizing policy choices on a per-application basis by choosing appropriate decay intervals individually, for each cache line. Our proposed adaptive policies effectively reduce Ll cache leakage energy by 5/spl times/ for the SPEC2000 with only negligible degradations in performance.",

Traditional approaches to disk power management involve completely stopping the disk rotation, which can take a considerable amount of time, making them less useful in cases where idle times between disk requests may not be long enough to outweigh the overheads. We present a new approach called DRPM to modulate disk speed (RPM) dynamically, and gives a practical implementation to exploit this mechanism. Extensive simulations with different workload and hardware parameters show that DRPM can provide significant energy savings without compromising much on performance. We also discuss practical issues when implementing DRPM on server disks.",

      "context": "A large portion of the power budget in server environments goes into the I/O subsystem - the disk array in particular. Traditional approaches to disk power management involve completely stopping the disk rotation, which can take a considerable amount of time, making them less useful in cases where idle times between disk requests may not be long enough to outweigh the overheads. We present a new approach called DRPM to modulate disk speed (RPM) dynamically, and gives a practical implementation to exploit this mechanism. Extensive simulations with different workload and hardware parameters show that DRPM can provide significant energy savings without compromising much on performance. We also discuss practical issues when implementing DRPM on server disks.",

Unfortunately, current error correction techniques are poorly suited to this emerging class of memory technologies. Unlike DRAM, PCM and other resistive memories have wear lifetimes, measured in writes, that are sufficiently short to make cell failures common during a system's lifetime. However, resistive memories are much less susceptible to transient faults than DRAM. The Hamming-based ECC codes used in DRAM are designed to handle transient faults with no effective lifetime limits, but ECC codes applied to resistive memories would wear out faster than the cells they are designed to repair. This paper evaluates Error-Correcting Pointers (ECP), a new approach to error correction optimized for memories in which errors are the result of permanent cell failures that occur, and are immediately detectable, at write time. ECP corrects errors by permanently encoding the locations of failed cells into a table and assigning cells to replace them. ECP provides longer lifetimes than previously proposed solutions with equivalent overhead. What's more, as the level of variance in cell lifetimes increases -- a likely consequence of further scalaing -- ECP's margin of improvement over existing schemes increases.",

      "context": "As leakage and other charge storage limitations begin to impair the scalability of DRAM, non-volatile resistive memories are being developed as a potential replacement. Unfortunately, current error correction techniques are poorly suited to this emerging class of memory technologies. Unlike DRAM, PCM and other resistive memories have wear lifetimes, measured in writes, that are sufficiently short to make cell failures common during a system's lifetime. However, resistive memories are much less susceptible to transient faults than DRAM. The Hamming-based ECC codes used in DRAM are designed to handle transient faults with no effective lifetime limits, but ECC codes applied to resistive memories would wear out faster than the cells they are designed to repair. This paper evaluates Error-Correcting Pointers (ECP), a new approach to error correction optimized for memories in which errors are the result of permanent cell failures that occur, and are immediately detectable, at write time. ECP corrects errors by permanently encoding the locations of failed cells into a table and assigning cells to replace them. ECP provides longer lifetimes than previously proposed solutions with equivalent overhead. What's more, as the level of variance in cell lifetimes increases -- a likely consequence of further scalaing -- ECP's margin of improvement over existing schemes increases.",

      "context": "Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) offer avenues to treat neurological disorders, shed light on brain function, and interface the brain with the digital world. Their wider adoption rests, however, on achieving adequate real-time performance, meeting stringent power constraints, and adhering to FDA-mandated safety requirements for chronic implantation. BCIs have, to date, been designed as custom ASICs for specific diseases or for specific tasks in specific brain regions. General-purpose architectures that can be used to treat multiple diseases and enable various computational tasks are needed for wider BCI adoption, but the conventional wisdom is that such systems cannot meet necessary performance and power constraints. We present HALO (Hardware Architecture for LOw-power BCIs), a general-purpose architecture for implantable BCIs. HALO enables tasks such as treatment of disorders (e.g., epilepsy, movement disorders), and records/processes data for studies that advance our understanding of the brain. We use electrophysiological data from the motor cortex of a non-human primate to determine how to decompose HALO's computational capabilities into hardware building blocks. We simplify, prune, and share these building blocks to judiciously use available hardware resources while enabling many modes of brain-computer interaction. The result is a configurable heterogeneous array of hardware processing elements (PEs). The PEs are configured by a low-power RISC-V micro-controller into signal processing pipelines that meet the target performance and power constraints necessary to deploy HALO widely and safely.",

      "context": "Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) offer avenues to treat neurological disorders, shed light on brain function, and interface the brain with the digital world. Their wider adoption rests, however, on achieving adequate real-time performance, meeting stringent power constraints, and adhering to FDA-mandated safety requirements for chronic implantation. BCIs have, to date, been designed as custom ASICs for specific diseases or for specific tasks in specific brain regions. General-purpose architectures that can be used to treat multiple diseases and enable various computational tasks are needed for wider BCI adoption, but the conventional wisdom is that such systems cannot meet necessary performance and power constraints. We present HALO (Hardware Architecture for LOw-power BCIs), a general-purpose architecture for implantable BCIs. HALO enables tasks such as treatment of disorders (e.g., epilepsy, movement disorders), and records/processes data for studies that advance our understanding of the brain. We use electrophysiological data from the motor cortex of a non-human primate to determine how to decompose HALO's computational capabilities into hardware building blocks. We simplify, prune, and share these building blocks to judiciously use available hardware resources while enabling many modes of brain-computer interaction. The result is a configurable heterogeneous array of hardware processing elements (PEs). The PEs are configured by a low-power RISC-V micro-controller into signal processing pipelines that meet the target performance and power constraints necessary to deploy HALO widely and safely.",

      "context": "This work observes that a large fraction of the computations performed by Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are intrinsically ineffectual as they involve a multiplication where one of the inputs is zero. This observation motivates Cnvolutin (CNV), a value-based approach to hardware acceleration that eliminates most of these ineffectual operations, improving performance and energy over a state-of-the-art accelerator with no accuracy loss. CNV uses hierarchical data-parallel units, allowing groups of lanes to proceed mostly independently enabling them to skip over the ineffectual computations. A co-designed data storage format encodes the computation elimination decisions taking them off the critical path while avoiding control divergence in the data parallel units. Combined, the units and the data storage format result in a data-parallel architecture that maintains wide, aligned accesses to its memory hierarchy and that keeps its data lanes busy. By loosening the ineffectual computation identification criterion, CNV enables further performance and energy efficiency improvements, and more so if a loss in accuracy is acceptable. Experimental measurements over a set of state-of-the-art DNNs for image classification show that CNV improves performance over a state-of-the-art accelerator from 1.24x to 1.55x and by 1.37x on average without any loss in accuracy by removing zero-valued operand multiplications alone. While CNV incurs an area overhead of 4.49%, it improves overall EDP (Energy Delay Product) and ED2P (Energy Delay Squared Product) on average by 1.47x and 2.01x, respectively. The average performance improvements increase to 1.52x without any loss in accuracy with a broader ineffectual identification policy. Further improvements are demonstrated with a loss in accuracy.",

Based on a design study using the next generation 0.25&micro;m, 256Mbit dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) process and on the analysis of existing machines, we show that processor memory integration can be used to build competitive, scalable and cost-effective MP systems.We present results from execution driven uni- and multi-processor simulations showing that the benefits of lower latency and higher bandwidth can compensate for the restrictions on the size and complexity of the integrated processor. In this system, small direct mapped instruction caches with long lines are very effective, as are column buffer data caches augmented with a victim cache.",

      "context": "Processing-in-memory (PIM) is a promising solution to address the \"memory wall\" challenges for future computer systems. Prior proposed PIM architectures put additional computation logic in or near memory. The emerging metal-oxide resistive random access memory (ReRAM) has showed its potential to be used for main memory. Moreover, with its crossbar array structure, ReRAM can perform matrix-vector multiplication efficiently, and has been widely studied to accelerate neural network (NN) applications. In this work, we propose a novel PIM architecture, called PRIME, to accelerate NN applications in ReRAM based main memory. In PRIME, a portion of ReRAM crossbar arrays can be configured as accelerators for NN applications or as normal memory for a larger memory space. We provide microarchitecture and circuit designs to enable the morphable functions with an insignificant area overhead. We also design a software/hardware interface for software developers to implement various NNs on PRIME. Benefiting from both the PIM architecture and the efficiency of using ReRAM for NN computation, PRIME distinguishes itself from prior work on NN acceleration, with significant performance improvement and energy saving. Our experimental results show that, compared with a state-of-the-art neural processing unit design, PRIME improves the performance by ~2360x and the energy consumption by ~895x, across the evaluated machine learning benchmarks.",

      "context": "Machine-learning (ML) hardware and software system demand is burgeoning. Driven by ML applications, the number of different ML inference systems has exploded. Over 100 organizations are building ML inference chips, and the systems that incorporate existing models span at least three orders of magnitude in power consumption and five orders of magnitude in performance; they range from embedded devices to data-center solutions. Fueling the hardware are a dozen or more software frameworks and libraries. The myriad combinations of ML hardware and ML software make assessing ML-system performance in an architecture-neutral, representative, and reproducible manner challenging. There is a clear need for industry-wide standard ML benchmarking and evaluation criteria. MLPerf Inference answers that call. In this paper, we present our benchmarking method for evaluating ML inference systems. Driven by more than 30 organizations as well as more than 200 ML engineers and practitioners, MLPerf prescribes a set of rules and best practices to ensure comparability across systems with wildly differing architectures. The first call for submissions garnered more than 600 reproducible inference-performance measurements from 14 organizations, representing over 30 systems that showcase a wide range of capabilities. The submissions attest to the benchmark\u2019s flexibility and adaptability.",

Modern processors provide enough performance counters to validate the majority of the performance models; nevertheless, the information provided is not enough to validate power and thermal models. In order to address some of the difficulties associated with the validation of power andthermal models, this paper proposes an infrared measurement setup to capture run-time power consumption and thermal characteristics of modern chips. We use infrared cameras with high spatial resolution (10x10\u03bcm) and high frame rate (125fps) to capture thermal maps. To generate a detailed power breakdown (leakage and dynamic) for each processor floorplan unit, we employ genetic algorithms. The genetic algorithm finds a power equation for each floorplan block that produces the measured temperature for a given thermal package. The difference between the predicted power and the externally measured power consumption for an AMD Athlon analyzed in this paper has less than 1% discrepancy. As an example of applicability, we compare the obtained measurements with CACTI power models, and propose extensions to existing thermal models to increase accuracy.",

As an example of applicability, we compare the obtained measurements with CACTI power models, and propose extensions to existing thermal models to increase accuracy.",
      "question": "Traditional performance counters, while useful for validating many performance models, are insufficient for accurate power and thermal modeling because they ____.\nA) do not provide granular enough information about power distribution and heat generation within the chip.\nB) only measure average values over long periods, missing transient thermal behavior.\nC) are primarily focused on instruction execution and memory access patterns.\nD) cannot capture the impact of different manufacturing process variations on power consumption.",

      "context": "Numerous studies have shown that datacenter computers rarely operate at full utilization, leading to a number of proposals for creating servers that are energy proportional with respect to the computation that they are performing. In this paper, we show that as servers themselves become more energy proportional, the datacenter network can become a significant fraction (up to 50%) of cluster power. In this paper we propose several ways to design a high-performance datacenter network whose power consumption is more proportional to the amount of traffic it is moving -- that is, we propose energy proportional datacenter networks. We first show that a flattened butterfly topology itself is inherently more power efficient than the other commonly proposed topology for high-performance datacenter networks. We then exploit the characteristics of modern plesiochronous links to adjust their power and performance envelopes dynamically. Using a network simulator, driven by both synthetic workloads and production datacenter traces, we characterize and understand design tradeoffs, and demonstrate an 85% reduction in power --- which approaches the ideal energy-proportionality of the network. Our results also demonstrate two challenges for the designers of future network switches: 1) We show that there is a significant power advantage to having independent control of each unidirectional channel comprising a network link, since many traffic patterns show very asymmetric use, and 2) system designers should work to optimize the high-speed channel designs to be more energy efficient by choosing optimal data rate and equalization technology. Given these assumptions, we demonstrate that energy proportional datacenter communication is indeed possible.",

      "context": "Numerous studies have shown that datacenter computers rarely operate at full utilization, leading to a number of proposals for creating servers that are energy proportional with respect to the computation that they are performing. In this paper, we show that as servers themselves become more energy proportional, the datacenter network can become a significant fraction (up to 50%) of cluster power. In this paper we propose several ways to design a high-performance datacenter network whose power consumption is more proportional to the amount of traffic it is moving -- that is, we propose energy proportional datacenter networks. We first show that a flattened butterfly topology itself is inherently more power efficient than the other commonly proposed topology for high-performance datacenter networks. We then exploit the characteristics of modern plesiochronous links to adjust their power and performance envelopes dynamically. Using a network simulator, driven by both synthetic workloads and production datacenter traces, we characterize and understand design tradeoffs, and demonstrate an 85% reduction in power --- which approaches the ideal energy-proportionality of the network. Our results also demonstrate two challenges for the designers of future network switches: 1) We show that there is a significant power advantage to having independent control of each unidirectional channel comprising a network link, since many traffic patterns show very asymmetric use, and 2) system designers should work to optimize the high-speed channel designs to be more energy efficient by choosing optimal data rate and equalization technology. Given these assumptions, we demonstrate that energy proportional datacenter communication is indeed possible.",
      "question": "To achieve energy proportionality in datacenter networks, designers must consider not just overall network traffic, but also ____.\nA) the specific network topology employed\nB) the choice of routing algorithm\nC) the average packet size\nD) the asymmetry of traffic flow across individual links",

      "context": "Memory isolation is a key property of a reliable and secure computing system--an access to one memory address should not have unintended side effects on data stored in other addresses. However, as DRAM process technology scales down to smaller dimensions, it becomes more difficult to prevent DRAM cells from electrically interacting with each other. In this paper, we expose the vulnerability of commodity DRAM chips to disturbance errors. By reading from the same address in DRAM, we show that it is possible to corrupt data in nearby addresses. More specifically, activating the same row in DRAM corrupts data in nearby rows. We demonstrate this phenomenon on Intel and AMD systems using a malicious program that generates many DRAM accesses. We induce errors in most DRAM modules (110 out of 129) from three major DRAM manufacturers. From this we conclude that many deployed systems are likely to be at risk. We identify the root cause of disturbance errors as the repeated toggling of a DRAM row's wordline, which stresses inter-cell coupling effects that accelerate charge leakage from nearby rows. We provide an extensive characterization study of disturbance errors and their behavior using an FPGA-based testing platform. Among our key findings, we show that (i) it takes as few as 139K accesses to induce an error and (ii) up to one in every 1.7K cells is susceptible to errors. After examining various potential ways of addressing the problem, we propose a low-overhead solution to prevent the errors",

However, as DRAM process technology scales down to smaller dimensions, it becomes more difficult to prevent DRAM cells from electrically interacting with each other. In this paper, we expose the vulnerability of commodity DRAM chips to disturbance errors. By reading from the same address in DRAM, we show that it is possible to corrupt data in nearby addresses. More specifically, activating the same row in DRAM corrupts data in nearby rows. We demonstrate this phenomenon on Intel and AMD systems using a malicious program that generates many DRAM accesses. We induce errors in most DRAM modules (110 out of 129) from three major DRAM manufacturers. From this we conclude that many deployed systems are likely to be at risk. We identify the root cause of disturbance errors as the repeated toggling of a DRAM row's wordline, which stresses inter-cell coupling effects that accelerate charge leakage from nearby rows. We provide an extensive characterization study of disturbance errors and their behavior using an FPGA-based testing platform. Among our key findings, we show that (i) it takes as few as 139K accesses to induce an error and (ii) up to one in every 1.7K cells is susceptible to errors. After examining various potential ways of addressing the problem, we propose a low-overhead solution to prevent the errors",

A wide range of biologically interesting phenomena, however, occur over time scales on the order of a millisecond--about three orders of magnitude beyond the duration of the longest current MD simulations. In this paper, we describe a massively parallel machine called Anton, which should be capable of executing millisecond-scale classical MD simulations of such biomolecular systems. The machine, which is scheduled for completion by the end of 2008, is based on 512 identical MD-specific ASICs that interact in a tightly coupled manner using a specialized high-speed communication network. Anton has been designed to use both novel parallel algorithms and special-purpose logic to dramatically accelerate those calculations that dominate the time required for a typical MD simulation. The remainder of the simulation algorithm is executed by a programmable portion of each chip that achieves a substantial degree of parallelism while preserving the flexibility necessary to accommodate anticipated advances in physical models and simulation methods.",

      "context": "The ability to perform long, accurate molecular dynamics (MD) simulations involving proteins and other biological macro-molecules could in principle provide answers to some of the most important currently outstanding questions in the fields of biology, chemistry and medicine. A wide range of biologically interesting phenomena, however, occur over time scales on the order of a millisecond--about three orders of magnitude beyond the duration of the longest current MD simulations. In this paper, we describe a massively parallel machine called Anton, which should be capable of executing millisecond-scale classical MD simulations of such biomolecular systems. The machine, which is scheduled for completion by the end of 2008, is based on 512 identical MD-specific ASICs that interact in a tightly coupled manner using a specialized high-speed communication network. Anton has been designed to use both novel parallel algorithms and special-purpose logic to dramatically accelerate those calculations that dominate the time required for a typical MD simulation. The remainder of the simulation algorithm is executed by a programmable portion of each chip that achieves a substantial degree of parallelism while preserving the flexibility necessary to accommodate anticipated advances in physical models and simulation methods.",

This paper explores the sources of these performance and energy overheads in general-purpose processing systems by quantifying the overheads of a 720p HD H.264 encoder running on a general-purpose CMP system. It then explores methods to eliminate these overheads by transforming the CPU into a specialized system for H.264 encoding. We evaluate the gains from customizations useful to broad classes of algorithms, such as SIMD units, as well as those specific to particular computation, such as customized storage and functional units. The ASIC is 500x more energy efficient than our original four-processor CMP. Broadly applicable optimizations improve performance by 10x and energy by 7x. However, the very low energy costs of actual core ops (100s fJ in 90nm) mean that over 90% of the energy used in these solutions is still \"overhead\". Achieving ASIC-like performance and efficiency requires algorithm-specific optimizations. For each sub-algorithm of H.264, we create a large, specialized functional unit that is capable of executing 100s of operations per instruction.

      "context": "Many architects believe that major improvements in cost-energy-performance must now come from domain-specific hardware. This paper evaluates a custom ASIC---called a Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) --- deployed in datacenters since 2015 that accelerates the inference phase of neural networks (NN). The heart of the TPU is a 65,536 8-bit MAC matrix multiply unit that offers a peak throughput of 92 TeraOps/second (TOPS) and a large (28 MiB) software-managed on-chip memory. The TPU's deterministic execution model is a better match to the 99th-percentile response-time requirement of our NN applications than are the time-varying optimizations of CPUs and GPUs that help average throughput more than guaranteed latency. The lack of such features helps explain why, despite having myriad MACs and a big memory, the TPU is relatively small and low power. We compare the TPU to a server-class Intel Haswell CPU and an Nvidia K80 GPU, which are contemporaries deployed in the same datacenters. Our workload, written in the high-level TensorFlow framework, uses production NN applications (MLPs, CNNs, and LSTMs) that represent 95% of our datacenters' NN inference demand. Despite low utilization for some applications, the TPU is on average about 15X -- 30X faster than its contemporary GPU or CPU, with TOPS/Watt about 30X -- 80X higher. Moreover, using the CPU's GDDR5 memory in the TPU would triple achieved TOPS and raise TOPS/Watt to nearly 70X the GPU and 200X the CPU.",

      "context": "Many architects believe that major improvements in cost-energy-performance must now come from domain-specific hardware. This paper evaluates a custom ASIC---called a Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) --- deployed in datacenters since 2015 that accelerates the inference phase of neural networks (NN). The heart of the TPU is a 65,536 8-bit MAC matrix multiply unit that offers a peak throughput of 92 TeraOps/second (TOPS) and a large (28 MiB) software-managed on-chip memory. The TPU's deterministic execution model is a better match to the 99th-percentile response-time requirement of our NN applications than are the time-varying optimizations of CPUs and GPUs that help average throughput more than guaranteed latency. The lack of such features helps explain why, despite having myriad MACs and a big memory, the TPU is relatively small and low power. We compare the TPU to a server-class Intel Haswell CPU and an Nvidia K80 GPU, which are contemporaries deployed in the same datacenters. Our workload, written in the high-level TensorFlow framework, uses production NN applications (MLPs, CNNs, and LSTMs) that represent 95% of our datacenters' NN inference demand. Despite low utilization for some applications, the TPU is on average about 15X -- 30X faster than its contemporary GPU or CPU, with TOPS/Watt about 30X -- 80X higher. Moreover, using the CPU's GDDR5 memory in the TPU would triple achieved TOPS and raise TOPS/Watt to nearly 70X the GPU and 200X the CPU.",

This framework can be deployed in the cloud and exploit the FPGAs-as-a-service paradigm to provide cost-efficient secondary DNA analysis. We propose conceptualizing genomic reads and associated read attributes as a very large relational database and using extended SQL as a domain-specific language to construct queries that form various data manipulation operations. To accelerate such queries, we design a Genesis hardware library which consists of primitive hardware modules that can be composed to construct a dataflow architecture specialized for those queries. As a proof of concept for the Genesis framework, we present the architecture and the hardware implementation of several genomic analysis stages in the secondary analysis pipeline corresponding to the best known software analysis toolkit, GATK4 workflow proposed by the Broad Institute. We walk through the construction of genomic data analysis operations using a sequence of SQL-style queries and show how Genesis hardware library modules can be utilized to construct the hardware pipelines designed to accelerate such queries. We exploit parallelism and data reuse by utilizing a dataflow architecture along with the use of on-chip scratchpads as well as non-blocking APIs to manage the accelerators, allowing concurrent execution of the accelerator and the host. Our accelerated system deployed on the cloud FPGA performs up to 19.3\u00d7 better than GATK4 running on a commodity multi-core Xeon server and obtains up to 15\u00d7 better cost savings. We believe that if a software algorithm can be mapped onto a hardware library to utilize the underlying accelerator(s) using an already-standardized software interface such as SQL, while allowing the efficient mapping of such interface to primitive hardware modules as we have demonstrated here, it will expedite the acceleration of domain specific algorithms and allow the easy adaptation of algorithm changes.",

      "context": "In this paper, we describe our vision to accelerate algorithms in the domain of genomic data analysis by proposing a framework called Genesis (genome analysis) that contains an interface and an implementation of a system that processes genomic data efficiently. This framework can be deployed in the cloud and exploit the FPGAs-as-a-service paradigm to provide cost-efficient secondary DNA analysis. We propose conceptualizing genomic reads and associated read attributes as a very large relational database and using extended SQL as a domain-specific language to construct queries that form various data manipulation operations. To accelerate such queries, we design a Genesis hardware library which consists of primitive hardware modules that can be composed to construct a dataflow architecture specialized for those queries. As a proof of concept for the Genesis framework, we present the architecture and the hardware implementation of several genomic analysis stages in the secondary analysis pipeline corresponding to the best known software analysis toolkit, GATK4 workflow proposed by the Broad Institute. We walk through the construction of genomic data analysis operations using a sequence of SQL-style queries and show how Genesis hardware library modules can be utilized to construct the hardware pipelines designed to accelerate such queries. We exploit parallelism and data reuse by utilizing a dataflow architecture along with the use of on-chip scratchpads as well as non-blocking APIs to manage the accelerators, allowing concurrent execution of the accelerator and the host. Our accelerated system deployed on the cloud FPGA performs up to 19.3\u00d7 better than GATK4 running on a commodity multi-core Xeon server and obtains up to 15\u00d7 better cost savings. We believe that if a software algorithm can be mapped onto a hardware library to utilize the underlying accelerator(s) using an already-standardized software interface such as SQL, while allowing the efficient mapping of such interface to primitive hardware modules as we have demonstrated here, it will expedite the acceleration of domain specific algorithms and allow the easy adaptation of algorithm changes.",

      "context": "Simultaneous multithreading is a technique that permits multiple independent threads to issue multiple instructions each cycle. In previous work we demonstrated the performance potential of simultaneous multithreading, based on a somewhat idealized model. In this paper we show that the throughput gains from simultaneous multithreading can be achieved without extensive changes to a conventional wide-issue superscalar, either in hardware structures or sizes. We present an architecture for simultaneous multithreading that achieves three goals: (1) it minimizes the architectural impact on the conventional superscalar design, (2) it has minimal performance impact on a single thread executing alone, and (3) it achieves significant throughput gains when running multiple threads. Our simultaneous multithreading architecture achieves a throughput of 5.4 instructions per cycle, a 2.5-fold improvement over an unmodified superscalar with similar hardware resources. This speedup is enhanced by an advantage of multithreading previously unexploited in other architectures: the ability to favor for fetch and issue those threads most efficiently using the processor each cycle, thereby providing the \"best\" instructions to the processor.",

      "context": "This paper makes the case that pin bandwidth will be a critical consideration for future microprocessors. We show that many of the techniques used to tolerate growing memory latencies do so at the expense of increased bandwidth requirements. Using a decomposition of execution time, we show that for modern processors that employ aggressive memory latency tolerance techniques, wasted cycles due to insufficient bandwidth generally exceed those due to raw memory latencies. Given the importance of maximizing memory bandwidth, we calculate effective pin bandwidth, then estimate optimal effective pin bandwidth. We measure these quantities by determining the amount by which both caches and minimal-traffic caches filter accesses to the lower levels of the memory hierarchy. We see that there is a gap that can exceed two orders of magnitude between the total memory traffic generated by caches and the minimal-traffic caches---implying that the potential exists to increase effective pin bandwidth substantially. We decompose this traffic gap into four factors, and show they contribute quite differently to traffic reduction for different benchmarks. We conclude that, in the short term, pin bandwidth limitations will make more complex on-chip caches cost-effective. For example, flexible caches may allow individual applications to choose from a range of caching policies. In the long term, we predict that off-chip accesses will be so expensive that all system memory will reside on one or more processor chips.",

      "context": "Recent advances in computing have led to an explosion in the amount of data being generated. Processing the ever-growing data in a timely manner has made throughput computing an important aspect for emerging applications. Our analysis of a set of important throughput computing kernels shows that there is an ample amount of parallelism in these kernels which makes them suitable for today's multi-core CPUs and GPUs. In the past few years there have been many studies claiming GPUs deliver substantial speedups (between 10X and 1000X) over multi-core CPUs on these kernels. To understand where such large performance difference comes from, we perform a rigorous performance analysis and find that after applying optimizations appropriate for both CPUs and GPUs the performance gap between an Nvidia GTX280 processor and the Intel Core i7-960 processor narrows to only 2.5x on average. In this paper, we discuss optimization techniques for both CPU and GPU, analyze what architecture features contributed to performance differences between the two architectures, and recommend a set of architectural features which provide significant improvement in architectural efficiency for throughput kernels.",

      "answer": "C",
      "authors": "James Donald and Margaret Martonosi",
      "context": "Power density continues to increase exponentially with each new technology generation, posing a major challenge for thermal management in modern processors. Much past work has examined microarchitectural policies for reducing total chip power, but these techniques alone are insufficient if not aimed at mitigating individual hotspots. The industry's trend has been toward multicore architectures, which provide additional opportunities for dynamic thermal management. This paper explores various thermal management techniques that exploit the distributed nature of multicore processors. We classify these techniques in terms of core throttling policy, whether that policy is applied locally to a core or to the processor as a whole, and process migration policies. We use Turandot and a HotSpot-based thermal simulator to simulate a variety of workloads under thermal duress on a 4-core PowerPCtrade processor. Using benchmarks from the SPEC 2000 suite we characterize workloads in terms of instruction throughput as well as their effective duty cycles. Among a variety of options we find that distributed control-theoretic DVFS alone improves throughput by 2.5times under our test conditions. Our final design involves a PI-based core thermal controller and an outer control loop to decide process migrations. This policy avoids all thermal emergencies and yields an average of 2.6times speedup over the baseline across all workloads",

We propose a solution--from circuit to compiler-that enables general-purpose use of limited-precision, analog hardwareto accelerate \"approximable\" code---code that can tolerate imprecise execution. We utilize an algorithmic transformation that automatically converts approximable regions of code from a von Neumann model to an \"analog\" neural model. We outline the challenges of taking an analog approach, including restricted-range value encoding, limited precision in computation, circuit inaccuracies, noise, and constraints on supported topologies. We address these limitations with a combination of circuit techniques, a hardware/software interface, neuralnetwork training techniques, and compiler support. Analog neural acceleration provides whole application speedup of 3.7x and energy savings of 6.3x with quality loss less than 10% for all except one benchmark. These results show that using limited-precision analog circuits for code acceleration, through a neural approach, is both feasible and beneficial over a range of approximation-tolerant, emerging applications including financial analysis, signal processing, robotics, 3D gaming, compression, and image processing",

      "context": "As improvements in per-transistor speed and energy efficiency diminish, radical departures from conventional approaches are becoming critical to improving the performance and energy efficiency of general-purpose processors. We propose a solution--from circuit to compiler-that enables general-purpose use of limited-precision, analog hardwareto accelerate \"approximable\" code---code that can tolerate imprecise execution. We utilize an algorithmic transformation that automatically converts approximable regions of code from a von Neumann model to an \"analog\" neural model. We outline the challenges of taking an analog approach, including restricted-range value encoding, limited precision in computation, circuit inaccuracies, noise, and constraints on supported topologies. We address these limitations with a combination of circuit techniques, a hardware/software interface, neuralnetwork training techniques, and compiler support. Analog neural acceleration provides whole application speedup of 3.7x and energy savings of 6.3x with quality loss less than 10% for all except one benchmark. These results show that using limited-precision analog circuits for code acceleration, through a neural approach, is both feasible and beneficial over a range of approximation-tolerant, emerging applications including financial analysis, signal processing, robotics, 3D gaming, compression, and image processing",

Analog neural acceleration provides whole application speedup of 3.7x and energy savings of 6.3x with quality loss less than 10% for all except one benchmark. These results show that using limited-precision analog circuits for code acceleration, through a neural approach, is both feasible and beneficial over a range of approximation-tolerant, emerging applications including financial analysis, signal processing, robotics, 3D gaming, compression, and image processing",

      "context": "Software cache-based side channel attacks are a serious new class of threats for computers. Unlike physical side channel attacks that mostly target embedded cryptographic devices, cache-based side channel attacks can also undermine general purpose systems. The attacks are easy to perform, effective on most platforms, and do not require special instruments or excessive computation power. In recently demonstrated attacks on software implementations of ciphers like AES and RSA, the full key can be recovered by an unprivileged user program performing simple timing measurements based on cache misses. We first analyze these attacks, identifying cache interference as the root cause of these attacks. We identify two basic mitigation approaches: the partition-based approach eliminates cache interference whereas the randomization-based approach randomizes cache interference so that zero information can be inferred. We present new security-aware cache designs, the Partition-Locked cache (PLcache) and Random Permutation cache (RPcache), analyze and prove their security, and evaluate their performance. Our results show that our new cache designs with built-in security can defend against cache-based side channel attacks in general-rather than only specific attacks on a given cryptographic algorithm-with very little performance degradation and hardware cost.",

Unlike physical side channel attacks that mostly target embedded cryptographic devices, cache-based side channel attacks can also undermine general purpose systems. The attacks are easy to perform, effective on most platforms, and do not require special instruments or excessive computation power. In recently demonstrated attacks on software implementations of ciphers like AES and RSA, the full key can be recovered by an unprivileged user program performing simple timing measurements based on cache misses. We first analyze these attacks, identifying cache interference as the root cause of these attacks. We identify two basic mitigation approaches: the partition-based approach eliminates cache interference whereas the randomization-based approach randomizes cache interference so that zero information can be inferred. We present new security-aware cache designs, the Partition-Locked cache (PLcache) and Random Permutation cache (RPcache), analyze and prove their security, and evaluate their performance.

      "answer": "C",
      "authors": "Zhenghong Wang and Ruby B. Lee",
      "context": "Software cache-based side channel attacks are a serious new class of threats for computers. Unlike physical side channel attacks that mostly target embedded cryptographic devices, cache-based side channel attacks can also undermine general purpose systems. The attacks are easy to perform, effective on most platforms, and do not require special instruments or excessive computation power. In recently demonstrated attacks on software implementations of ciphers like AES and RSA, the full key can be recovered by an unprivileged user program performing simple timing measurements based on cache misses. We first analyze these attacks, identifying cache interference as the root cause of these attacks. We identify two basic mitigation approaches: the partition-based approach eliminates cache interference whereas the randomization-based approach randomizes cache interference so that zero information can be inferred. We present new security-aware cache designs, the Partition-Locked cache (PLcache) and Random Permutation cache (RPcache), analyze and prove their security, and evaluate their performance. Our results show that our new cache designs with built-in security can defend against cache-based side channel attacks in general-rather than only specific attacks on a given cryptographic algorithm-with very little performance degradation and hardware cost.",

      "context": "We expect that many-core microprocessors will push performance per chip from the 10 gigaflop to the 10 teraflop range in the coming decade. To support this increased performance, memory and inter-core bandwidths will also have to scale by orders of magnitude. Pin limitations, the energy cost of electrical signaling, and the non-scalability of chip-length global wires are significant bandwidth impediments. Recent developments in silicon nanophotonic technology have the potential to meet these off- and on-stack bandwidth requirements at acceptable power levels. Corona is a 3 D many-core architecture that uses nanophotonic communication for both inter-core communication and off-stack communication to memory or I/O devices. Its peak floating-point performance is 10 teraflops. Dense wavelength division multiplexed optically connected memory modules provide 10 terabyte per second memory bandwidth. A photonic crossbar fully interconnects its 256 low-power multithreaded cores at 20 terabyte per second bandwidth. We have simulated a 1024 thread Corona system running synthetic benchmarks and scaled versions of the SPLASH-2 benchmark suite. We believe that in comparison with an electrically-connected many-core alternative that uses the same on-stack interconnect power, Corona can provide 2 to 6 times more performance on many memory intensive workloads, while simultaneously reducing power.",

The proposed architecture consists of clusters of processing engines, connected by 2D mesh network as a processing tier, which is integrated in 3D with multiple tiers of DRAM. The PE clusters access multiple memory channels (vaults) in parallel. The operating principle, referred to as the memory centric computing, embeds specialized state-machines within the vault controllers of HMC to drive data into the PE clusters. The paper presents the basic architecture of the Neurocube and an analysis of the logic tier synthesized in 28nm and 15nm process technologies. The performance of the Neurocube is evaluated and illustrated through the mapping of a Convolutional Neural Network and estimating the subsequent power and performance for both training and inference.",

      "context": "Hardware acceleration of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) aims to tame their enormous compute intensity. Fully realizing the potential of acceleration in this domain requires understanding and leveraging algorithmic properties of DNNs. This paper builds upon the algorithmic insight that bitwidth of operations in DNNs can be reduced without compromising their classification accuracy. However, to prevent loss of accuracy, the bitwidth varies significantly across DNNs and it may even be adjusted for each layer individually. Thus, a fixed-bitwidth accelerator would either offer limited benefits to accommodate the worst-case bitwidth requirements, or inevitably lead to a degradation in final accuracy. To alleviate these deficiencies, this work introduces dynamic bit-level fusion/decomposition as a new dimension in the design of DNN accelerators. We explore this dimension by designing Bit Fusion, a bit-flexible accelerator, that constitutes an array of bit-level processing elements that dynamically fuse to match the bitwidth of individual DNN layers. This flexibility in the architecture enables minimizing the computation and the communication at the finest granularity possible with no loss in accuracy. We evaluate the benefits of Bit Fusion using eight real-world feed-forward and recurrent DNNs. The proposed microarchitecture is implemented in Verilog and synthesized in 45 nm technology. Using the synthesis results and cycle accurate simulation, we compare the benefits of Bit Fusion to two state-of-the-art DNN accelerators, Eyeriss and Stripes. In the same area, frequency, and process technology, Bit Fusion offers 3.9x speedup and 5.1x energy savings over Eyeriss. Compared to Stripes, Bit Fusion provides 2.6x speedup and 3.9x energy reduction at 45 nm node when Bit Fusion area and frequency are set to those of Stripes. Scaling to GPU technology node of 16 nm, Bit Fusion almost matches the performance of a 250-Watt Titan Xp, which uses 8-bit vector instructions, while Bit Fusion merely consumes 895 milliwatts of power.",

      "context": "Exploiting model sparsity to reduce ineffectual computation is a commonly used approach to achieve energy efficiency for DNN inference accelerators. However, due to the tightly coupled crossbar structure, exploiting sparsity for ReRAM-based NN accelerator is a less explored area. Existing architectural studies on ReRAM-based NN accelerators assume that an entire crossbar array can be activated in a single cycle. However, due to inference accuracy considerations, matrix-vector computation must be conducted in a smaller granularity in practice, called Operation Unit (OU). An OU-based architecture creates a new opportunity to exploit DNN sparsity. In this paper, we propose the first practical Sparse ReRAM Engine that exploits both weight and activation sparsity. Our evaluation shows that the proposed method is effective in eliminating ineffectual computation, and delivers significant performance improvement and energy savings.",

      "context": "The performance tradeoff between hardware complexity and clock speed is studied. First, a generic superscalar pipeline is defined. Then the specific areas of register renaming, instruction window wakeup and selection logic, and operand bypassing are analyzed. Each is modeled and Spice simulated for feature sizes of 0.8&micro;m, 0.35&micro;m, and 0.18&micro;m. Performance results and trends are expressed in terms of issue width and window size. Our analysis indicates that window wakeup and selection logic as well as operand bypass logic are likely to be the most critical in the future.A microarchitecture that simplifies wakeup and selection logic is proposed and discussed. This implementation puts chains of dependent instructions into queues, and issues instructions from multiple queues in parallel. Simulation shows little slowdown as compared with a completely flexible issue window when performance is measured in clock cycles. Furthermore, because only instructions at queue heads need to be awakened and selected, issue logic is simplified and the clock cycle is faster --- consequently overall performance is improved. By grouping dependent instructions together, the proposed microarchitecture will help minimize performance degradation due to slow bypasses in future wide-issue machines.",

      "answer": "B",
      "authors": "Moinuddin K. Qureshi",
      "context": "Conflict-based cache attacks can allow an adversary to infer the access pattern of a co-running application by orchestrating evictions via cache conflicts. Such attacks can be mitigated by randomizing the location of the lines in the cache. Our recent proposal, CEASER, makes cache randomization practical by accessing the cache using an encrypted address and periodically changing the encryption key. CEASER was analyzed with the state-of-the-art algorithm on forming eviction sets, and the analysis showed that CEASER with a Remap-Rate of 1% is sufficient to tolerate years of attack. In this paper, we present two new attacks that significantly push the state-of-the-art in forming eviction sets. Our first attack reduces the time required to form the eviction set from O(L2) to O(L), where L is the number of lines in the attack. This attack is 35x faster than the best-known attack and requires that the Remap-Rate of CEASER be increased to 35%. Our second attack exploits the replacement policy (we analyze LRU, RRIP, and Random) to form eviction set quickly and requires that the Remap-Rate of CEASER be increased to more than 100%, incurring impractical overheads. To improve the robustness of CEASER against these attacks in a practical manner, we propose Skewed-CEASER (CEASER-S), which divides the cache ways into multiple partitions and maps the cache line to be resident in a different set in each partition. This design significantly improves the robustness of CEASER, as the attacker must form an eviction set that can dislodge the line from multiple possible locations. We show that CEASER-S can tolerate years of attacks while retaining a Remap-Rate of 1%. CEASER-S incurs negligible slowdown (within 1%) and a storage overhead of less than 100 bytes for the newly added structures.",

      "context": "Conflict-based cache attacks can allow an adversary to infer the access pattern of a co-running application by orchestrating evictions via cache conflicts. Such attacks can be mitigated by randomizing the location of the lines in the cache. Our recent proposal, CEASER, makes cache randomization practical by accessing the cache using an encrypted address and periodically changing the encryption key. CEASER was analyzed with the state-of-the-art algorithm on forming eviction sets, and the analysis showed that CEASER with a Remap-Rate of 1% is sufficient to tolerate years of attack. In this paper, we present two new attacks that significantly push the state-of-the-art in forming eviction sets. Our first attack reduces the time required to form the eviction set from O(L2) to O(L), where L is the number of lines in the attack. This attack is 35x faster than the best-known attack and requires that the Remap-Rate of CEASER be increased to 35%. Our second attack exploits the replacement policy (we analyze LRU, RRIP, and Random) to form eviction set quickly and requires that the Remap-Rate of CEASER be increased to more than 100%, incurring impractical overheads. To improve the robustness of CEASER against these attacks in a practical manner, we propose Skewed-CEASER (CEASER-S), which divides the cache ways into multiple partitions and maps the cache line to be resident in a different set in each partition. This design significantly improves the robustness of CEASER, as the attacker must form an eviction set that can dislodge the line from multiple possible locations. We show that CEASER-S can tolerate years of attacks while retaining a Remap-Rate of 1%. CEASER-S incurs negligible slowdown (within 1%) and a storage overhead of less than 100 bytes for the newly added structures.",

      "context": "Heterogeneous memory management combined with server virtualization in datacenters is expected to increase the software and OS management complexity. State-of-the-art solutions rely exclusively on the hypervisor (VMM) for expensive page hotness tracking and migrations, limiting the benefits from heterogeneity. To address this, we design HeteroOS, a novel application-transparent OS-level solution for managing memory heterogeneity in virtualized system. The HeteroOS design first makes the guest-OSes heterogeneity-aware and then extracts rich OS-level information about applications' memory usage to place data in the 'right' memory avoiding page migrations. When such pro-active placements are not possible, HeteroOS combines the power of the guest-OSes' information about applications with the VMM's hardware control to track for hotness and migrate only performance-critical pages. Finally, HeteroOS also designs an efficient heterogeneous memory sharing across multiple guest-VMs. Evaluation of HeteroOS with memory, storage, and network-intensive datacenter applications shows up to 2x performance improvement compared to the state-of-the-art VMM-exclusive approach.",

      "context": "State-of-the-art deep neural networks (DNNs) have hundreds of millions of connections and are both computationally and memory intensive, making them difficult to deploy on embedded systems with limited hardware resources and power budgets. While custom hardware helps the computation, fetching weights from DRAM is two orders of magnitude more expensive than ALU operations, and dominates the required power. Previously proposed 'Deep Compression' makes it possible to fit large DNNs (AlexNet and VGGNet) fully in on-chip SRAM. This compression is achieved by pruning the redundant connections and having multiple connections share the same weight. We propose an energy efficient inference engine (EIE) that performs inference on this compressed network model and accelerates the resulting sparse matrix-vector multiplication with weight sharing. Going from DRAM to SRAM gives EIE 120x energy saving, Exploiting sparsity saves 10x, Weight sharing gives 8x, Skipping zero activations from ReLU saves another 3x. Evaluated on nine DNN benchmarks, EIE is 189x and 13x faster when compared to CPU and GPU implementations of the same DNN without compression. EIE has a processing power of 102 GOPS working directly on a compressed network, corresponding to 3 TOPS on an uncompressed network, and processes FC layers of AlexNet at 1.88x104 frames/sec with a power dissipation of only 600mW. It is 24,000x and 3,400x more energy efficient than a CPU and GPU respectively. Compared with DaDianNao, EIE has 2.9x, 19x and 3x better throughput, energy efficiency and area efficiency.",

      "context": "With the shift towards chip multiprocessors (CMPs), exploiting and managing parallelism has become a central problem in computing systems. Many issues of parallelism management boil down to discerning which running threads or processes are critical, or slowest, versus which are non-critical. If one can accurately predict critical threads in a parallel program, then one can respond in a variety of ways. Possibilities include running the critical thread at a faster clock rate, performing load balancing techniques to offload work onto currently non-critical threads, or giving the critical thread more on-chip resources to execute faster. This paper proposes and evaluates simple but effective thread criticality predictors for parallel applications. We show that accurate predictors can be built using counters that are typically already available on-chip. Our predictor, based on memory hierarchy statistics, identifies thread criticality with an average accuracy of 93% across a range of architectures. We also demonstrate two applications of our predictor. First, we show how Intel's Threading Building Blocks (TBB) parallel runtime system can benefit from task stealing techniques that use our criticality predictor to reduce load imbalance. Using criticality prediction to guide TBB's task-stealing decisions improves performance by 13-32% for TBB-based PARSEC benchmarks running on a 32-core CMP. As a second application, criticality prediction guides dynamic energy optimizations in barrier-based applications. By running the predicted critical thread at the full clock rate and frequency-scaling non-critical threads, this approach achieves average energy savings of 15% while negligibly degrading performance for SPLASH-2 and PARSEC benchmarks.",

      "context": "The commonly used LRU replacement policy is susceptible to thrashing for memory-intensive workloads that have a working set greater than the available cache size. For such applications, the majority of lines traverse from the MRU position to the LRU position without receiving any cache hits, resulting in inefficient use of cache space. Cache performance can be improved if some fraction of the working set is retained in the cache so that at least that fraction of the working set can contribute to cache hits. We show that simple changes to the insertion policy can significantly reduce cache misses for memory-intensive workloads. We propose the LRU Insertion Policy (LIP) which places the incoming line in the LRU position instead of the MRU position. LIP protects the cache from thrashing and results in close to optimal hitrate for applications that have a cyclic reference pattern. We also propose the Bimodal Insertion Policy (BIP) as an enhancement of LIP that adapts to changes in the working set while maintaining the thrashing protection of LIP. We finally propose a Dynamic Insertion Policy (DIP) to choose between BIP and the traditional LRU policy depending on which policy incurs fewer misses. The proposed insertion policies do not require any change to the existing cache structure, are trivial to implement, and have a storage requirement of less than two bytes. We show that DIP reduces the average MPKI of the baseline 1MB 16-way L2 cache by 21%, bridging two-thirds of the gap between LRU and OPT.",

Cache performance can be improved if some fraction of the working set is retained in the cache so that at least that fraction of the working set can contribute to cache hits.

      "context": "GPU architectures are increasingly important in the multi-core era due to their high number of parallel processors. Programming thousands of massively parallel threads is a big challenge for software engineers, but understanding the performance bottlenecks of those parallel programs on GPU architectures to improve application performance is even more difficult. Current approaches rely on programmers to tune their applications by exploiting the design space exhaustively without fully understanding the performance characteristics of their applications. To provide insights into the performance bottlenecks of parallel applications on GPU architectures, we propose a simple analytical model that estimates the execution time of massively parallel programs. The key component of our model is estimating the number of parallel memory requests (we call this the memory warp parallelism) by considering the number of running threads and memory bandwidth. Based on the degree of memory warp parallelism, the model estimates the cost of memory requests, thereby estimating the overall execution time of a program. Comparisons between the outcome of the model and the actual execution time in several GPUs show that the geometric mean of absolute error of our model on micro-benchmarks is 5.4% and on GPU computing applications is 13.3%. All the applications are written in the CUDA programming language.",

Programming thousands of massively parallel threads is a big challenge for software engineers, but understanding the performance bottlenecks of those parallel programs on GPU architectures to improve application performance is even more difficult. Current approaches rely on programmers to tune their applications by exploiting the design space exhaustively without fully understanding the performance characteristics of their applications. To provide insights into the performance bottlenecks of parallel applications on GPU architectures, we propose a simple analytical model that estimates the execution time of massively parallel programs. The key component of our model is estimating the number of parallel memory requests (we call this the memory warp parallelism) by considering the number of running threads and memory bandwidth. Based on the degree of memory warp parallelism, the model estimates the cost of memory requests, thereby estimating the overall execution time of a program. Comparisons between the outcome of the model and the actual execution time in several GPUs show that the geometric mean of absolute error of our model on micro-benchmarks is 5.4% and on GPU computing applications is 13.3%.

      "context": "Efficiently utilizing off-chip DRAM bandwidth is a critical issuein designing cost-effective, high-performance chip multiprocessors(CMPs). Conventional memory controllers deliver relativelylow performance in part because they often employ fixed,rigid access scheduling policies designed for average-case applicationbehavior. As a result, they cannot learn and optimizethe long-term performance impact of their scheduling decisions,and cannot adapt their scheduling policies to dynamic workloadbehavior.We propose a new, self-optimizing memory controller designthat operates using the principles of reinforcement learning (RL)to overcome these limitations. Our RL-based memory controllerobserves the system state and estimates the long-term performanceimpact of each action it can take. In this way, the controllerlearns to optimize its scheduling policy on the fly to maximizelong-term performance. Our results show that an RL-basedmemory controller improves the performance of a set of parallelapplications run on a 4-core CMP by 19% on average (upto 33%), and it improves DRAM bandwidth utilization by 22%compared to a state-of-the-art controller.",

      "context": "We present FireSim, an open-source simulation platform that enables cycle-exact microarchitectural simulation of large scale-out clusters by combining FPGA-accelerated simulation of silicon-proven RTL designs with a scalable, distributed network simulation. Unlike prior FPGA-accelerated simulation tools, FireSim runs on Amazon EC2 F1, a public cloud FPGA platform, which greatly improves usability, provides elasticity, and lowers the cost of large-scale FPGA-based experiments. We describe the design and implementation of FireSim and show how it can provide sufficient performance to run modern applications at scale, to enable true hardware-software co-design. As an example, we demonstrate automatically generating and deploying a target cluster of 1,024 3.2 GHz quad-core server nodes, each with 16 GB of DRAM, interconnected by a 200 Gbit/s network with 2 microsecond latency, which simulates at a 3.4 MHz processor clock rate (less than 1,000x slowdown over real-time). In aggregate, this FireSim instantiation simulates 4,096 cores and 16 TB of memory, runs ~14 billion instructions per second, and harnesses 12.8 million dollars worth of FPGAs\u2014at a total cost of only ~$100 per simulation hour to the user. We present several examples to show how FireSim can be used to explore various research directions in warehouse-scale machine design, including modeling networks with high-bandwidth and low-latency, integrating arbitrary RTL designs for a variety of commodity and specialized datacenter nodes, and modeling a variety of datacenter organizations, as well as reusing the scale-out FireSim infrastructure to enable fast, massively parallel cycle-exact single-node microarchitectural experimentation.",

      "context": "Reconfigurable architectures have gained popularity in recent years as they allow the design of energy-efficient accelerators. Fine-grain fabrics (e.g. FPGAs) have traditionally suffered from performance and power inefficiencies due to bit-level reconfigurable abstractions. Both fine-grain and coarse-grain architectures (e.g. CGRAs) traditionally require low level programming and suffer from long compilation times. We address both challenges with Plasticine, a new spatially reconfigurable architecture designed to efficiently execute applications composed of parallel patterns. Parallel patterns have emerged from recent research on parallel programming as powerful, high-level abstractions that can elegantly capture data locality, memory access patterns, and parallelism across a wide range of dense and sparse applications. We motivate Plasticine by first observing key application characteristics captured by parallel patterns that are amenable to hardware acceleration, such as hierarchical parallelism, data locality, memory access patterns, and control flow. Based on these observations, we architect Plasticine as a collection of Pattern Compute Units and Pattern Memory Units. Pattern Compute Units are multi-stage pipelines of reconfigurable SIMD functional units that can efficiently execute nested patterns. Data locality is exploited in Pattern Memory Units using banked scratchpad memories and configurable address decoders. Multiple on-chip address generators and scatter-gather engines make efficient use of DRAM bandwidth by supporting a large number of outstanding memory requests, memory coalescing, and burst mode for dense accesses. Plasticine has an area footprint of 113 mm2 in a 28nm process, and consumes a maximum power of 49 W at a 1 GHz clock. Using a cycle-accurate simulator, we demonstrate that Plasticine provides an improvement of up to 76.9x in performance-per-Watt over a conventional FPGA over a wide range of dense and sparse applications.",

      "context": "Although VLIW architectures offer the advantages of simplicity of design and high issue rates, a major impediment to their use is that they are not compatible with the existing software base. We describe new simple hardware features for a VLIW machine we call DAISY (Dynamically Architected Instruction Set from Yorktown). DAISY is specifically intended to emulate existing architectures, so that all existing software for an old architecture (including operating system kernel code) runs without changes on the VLIW. Each time a new fragment of code is executed for the first time, the code is translated to VLIW primitives, parallelized and saved in a portion of main memory not visible to the old architecture, by a Virtual Machine Monitor (software) residing in read only memory. Subsequent executions of the same fragment do not require a translation (unless cast out). We discuss the architectural requirements for such a VLIW, to deal with issues including self-modifying code, precise exceptions, and aggressive reordering of memory references in the presence of strong MP consistency and memory mapped I/O. We have implemented the dynamic parallelization algorithms for the PowerPC architecture. The initial results show high degrees of instruction level parallelism with reasonable translation overhead and memory usage.",

      "context": "The processors that drive embedded systems are getting smaller; meanwhile, the batteries used to provide power to those systems have stagnated. If we are to realize the dream of ubiquitous computing promised by the Internet of Things, processors must shed large, heavy, expensive, and high maintenance batteries and, instead, harvest energy from their environment. One challenge with this transition is that harvested energy is insufficient for continuous operation. Unfortunately, existing programs fail miserably when executed intermittently. This paper presents Clank: lightweight architectural support for correct and efficient execution of long-running applications on harvested energy---without programmer intervention or extreme hardware modifications. Clank is a set of hardware buffers and memory-access monitors that dynamically maintain idempotency. Essentially, Clank dynamically decomposes program execution into a stream of restartable sub-executions connected via lightweight checkpoints. To validate Clank's ability to correctly stretch program execution across frequent, random power cycles, and to explore the associated hardware and software overheads, we implement Clank in Verilog, formally verify it, and then add it to an ARM Cortex M0+ processor which we use to run a set of 23 embedded systems benchmarks. Experiments show run-time overheads as low as 2.5%, with run-time overheads of 6% for a version of Clank that adds 1.7% hardware. Clank minimizes checkpoints so much that re-execution time becomes the dominate contributor to run-time overhead.",

The growing demand for computationally expensive, state-of-the-art DNNs, coupled with diminishing performance gains of general-purpose architectures, has fueled an explosion of specialized Neural Processing Units (NPUs). NPUs for interactive services should satisfy two requirements: (1) execution of DNN models with low latency, high throughput, and high efficiency, and (2) flexibility to accommodate evolving state-of-the-art models (e.g., RNNs, CNNs, MLPs) without costly silicon updates. This paper describes the NPU architecture for Project Brainwave, a production-scale system for real-time AI. The Brainwave NPU achieves more than an order of magnitude improvement in latency and throughput over state-of-the-art GPUs on large RNNs at a batch size of 1. The NPU attains this performance using a single-threaded SIMD ISA paired with a distributed microarchitecture capable of dispatching over 7M operations from a single instruction. The spatially distributed microarchitecture, scaled up to 96,000 multiply-accumulate units, is supported by hierarchical instruction decoders and schedulers coupled with thousands of independently addressable high-bandwidth on-chip memories, and can transparently exploit many levels of fine-grain SIMD parallelism. When targeting an FPGA, microarchitectural parameters such as native datapaths and numerical precision can be \"synthesis specialized\" to models at compile time, enabling atypically high FPGA performance competitive with hardened NPUs. When running on an Intel Stratix 10 280 FPGA, the Brainwave NPU achieves performance ranging from ten to over thirty-five teraflops, with no batching, on large, memory-intensive RNNs.",

The spatially distributed microarchitecture, scaled up to 96,000 multiply-accumulate units, is supported by hierarchical instruction decoders and schedulers coupled with thousands of independently addressable high-bandwidth on-chip memories, and can transparently exploit many levels of fine-grain SIMD parallelism. When targeting an FPGA, microarchitectural parameters such as native datapaths and numerical precision can be \"synthesis specialized\" to models at compile time, enabling atypically high FPGA performance competitive with hardened NPUs. When running on an Intel Stratix 10 280 FPGA, the Brainwave NPU achieves performance ranging from ten to over thirty-five teraflops, with no batching, on large, memory-intensive RNNs.",
      "question": "To achieve both low latency and high throughput for real-time AI inference with evolving DNN models, an NPU architecture should prioritize _____.\nA) Minimizing power consumption above all else.\nB) Focusing solely on optimizing for a specific DNN type, like CNNs.\nC) Maximizing clock frequency regardless of area and power constraints.\nD) Balancing specialization for performance with flexibility to accommodate different model types.",

Effective powerprovisioning strategies are needed to determine how much computing equipmentcan be safely and efficiently hosted within a given power budget.

      "context": "The memory subsystem accounts for a significant cost and power budget of a computer system. Current DRAM-based main memory systems are starting to hit the power and cost limit. An alternative memory technology that uses resistance contrast in phase-change materials is being actively investigated in the circuits community. Phase Change Memory (PCM) devices offer more density relative to DRAM, and can help increase main memory capacity of future systems while remaining within the cost and power constraints. In this paper, we analyze a PCM-based hybrid main memory system using an architecture level model of PCM.We explore the trade-offs for a main memory system consisting of PCMstorage coupled with a small DRAM buffer. Such an architecture has the latency benefits of DRAM and the capacity benefits of PCM. Our evaluations for a baseline system of 16-cores with 8GB DRAM show that, on average, PCM can reduce page faults by 5X and provide a speedup of 3X. As PCM is projected to have limited write endurance, we also propose simple organizational and management solutions of the hybrid memory that reduces the write traffic to PCM, boosting its lifetime from 3 years to 9.7 years.",
