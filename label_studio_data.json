      "context": "Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are widely used in modern AI systems for their superior accuracy but at the cost of high computational complexity. The complexity comes from the need to simultaneously process hundreds of filters and channels in the high-dimensional convolutions, which involve a significant amount of data movement. Although highly-parallel compute paradigms, such as SIMD/SIMT, effectively address the computation requirement to achieve high throughput, energy consumption still remains high as data movement can be more expensive than computation. Accordingly, finding a dataflow that supports parallel processing with minimal data movement cost is crucial to achieving energy-efficient CNN processing without compromising accuracy. In this paper, we present a novel dataflow, called row-stationary (RS), that minimizes data movement energy consumption on a spatial architecture. This is realized by exploiting local data reuse of filter weights and feature map pixels, i.e., activations, in the high-dimensional convolutions, and minimizing data movement of partial sum accumulations. Unlike dataflows used in existing designs, which only reduce certain types of data movement, the proposed RS dataflow can adapt to different CNN shape configurations and reduces all types of data movement through maximally utilizing the processing engine (PE) local storage, direct inter-PE communication and spatial parallelism. To evaluate the energy efficiency of the different dataflows, we propose an analysis framework that compares energy cost under the same hardware area and processing parallelism constraints. Experiments using the CNN configurations of AlexNet show that the proposed RS dataflow is more energy efficient than existing dataflows in both convolutional (1.4\u00d7 to 2.5\u00d7) and fully-connected layers (at least 1.3\u00d7 for batch size larger than 16). The RS dataflow has also been demonstrated on a fabricated chip, which verifies our energy analysis.",

      "authors": "Yu-Hsin Chen, Joel Emer, and Vivienne Sze",
      "context": "Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are widely used in modern AI systems for their superior accuracy but at the cost of high computational complexity. The complexity comes from the need to simultaneously process hundreds of filters and channels in the high-dimensional convolutions, which involve a significant amount of data movement. Although highly-parallel compute paradigms, such as SIMD/SIMT, effectively address the computation requirement to achieve high throughput, energy consumption still remains high as data movement can be more expensive than computation. Accordingly, finding a dataflow that supports parallel processing with minimal data movement cost is crucial to achieving energy-efficient CNN processing without compromising accuracy. In this paper, we present a novel dataflow, called row-stationary (RS), that minimizes data movement energy consumption on a spatial architecture. This is realized by exploiting local data reuse of filter weights and feature map pixels, i.e., activations, in the high-dimensional convolutions, and minimizing data movement of partial sum accumulations. Unlike dataflows used in existing designs, which only reduce certain types of data movement, the proposed RS dataflow can adapt to different CNN shape configurations and reduces all types of data movement through maximally utilizing the processing engine (PE) local storage, direct inter-PE communication and spatial parallelism. To evaluate the energy efficiency of the different dataflows, we propose an analysis framework that compares energy cost under the same hardware area and processing parallelism constraints. Experiments using the CNN configurations of AlexNet show that the proposed RS dataflow is more energy efficient than existing dataflows in both convolutional (1.4\u00d7 to 2.5\u00d7) and fully-connected layers (at least 1.3\u00d7 for batch size larger than 16). The RS dataflow has also been demonstrated on a fabricated chip, which verifies our energy analysis.",

      "context": "Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are widely used in modern AI systems for their superior accuracy but at the cost of high computational complexity. The complexity comes from the need to simultaneously process hundreds of filters and channels in the high-dimensional convolutions, which involve a significant amount of data movement. Although highly-parallel compute paradigms, such as SIMD/SIMT, effectively address the computation requirement to achieve high throughput, energy consumption still remains high as data movement can be more expensive than computation. Accordingly, finding a dataflow that supports parallel processing with minimal data movement cost is crucial to achieving energy-efficient CNN processing without compromising accuracy. In this paper, we present a novel dataflow, called row-stationary (RS), that minimizes data movement energy consumption on a spatial architecture. This is realized by exploiting local data reuse of filter weights and feature map pixels, i.e., activations, in the high-dimensional convolutions, and minimizing data movement of partial sum accumulations. Unlike dataflows used in existing designs, which only reduce certain types of data movement, the proposed RS dataflow can adapt to different CNN shape configurations and reduces all types of data movement through maximally utilizing the processing engine (PE) local storage, direct inter-PE communication and spatial parallelism. To evaluate the energy efficiency of the different dataflows, we propose an analysis framework that compares energy cost under the same hardware area and processing parallelism constraints. Experiments using the CNN configurations of AlexNet show that the proposed RS dataflow is more energy efficient than existing dataflows in both convolutional (1.4\u00d7 to 2.5\u00d7) and fully-connected layers (at least 1.3\u00d7 for batch size larger than 16). The RS dataflow has also been demonstrated on a fabricated chip, which verifies our energy analysis.",

      "context": "Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are widely used in modern AI systems for their superior accuracy but at the cost of high computational complexity. The complexity comes from the need to simultaneously process hundreds of filters and channels in the high-dimensional convolutions, which involve a significant amount of data movement. Although highly-parallel compute paradigms, such as SIMD/SIMT, effectively address the computation requirement to achieve high throughput, energy consumption still remains high as data movement can be more expensive than computation. Accordingly, finding a dataflow that supports parallel processing with minimal data movement cost is crucial to achieving energy-efficient CNN processing without compromising accuracy. In this paper, we present a novel dataflow, called row-stationary (RS), that minimizes data movement energy consumption on a spatial architecture. This is realized by exploiting local data reuse of filter weights and feature map pixels, i.e., activations, in the high-dimensional convolutions, and minimizing data movement of partial sum accumulations. Unlike dataflows used in existing designs, which only reduce certain types of data movement, the proposed RS dataflow can adapt to different CNN shape configurations and reduces all types of data movement through maximally utilizing the processing engine (PE) local storage, direct inter-PE communication and spatial parallelism. To evaluate the energy efficiency of the different dataflows, we propose an analysis framework that compares energy cost under the same hardware area and processing parallelism constraints. Experiments using the CNN configurations of AlexNet show that the proposed RS dataflow is more energy efficient than existing dataflows in both convolutional (1.4\u00d7 to 2.5\u00d7) and fully-connected layers (at least 1.3\u00d7 for batch size larger than 16). The RS dataflow has also been demonstrated on a fabricated chip, which verifies our energy analysis.",

      "answer": "D",
      "authors": "Jamie Liu, Ben Jaiyen, Richard Veras, and Onur Mutlu",
      "context": "Dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) is the building block of modern main memory systems. DRAM cells must be periodically refreshed to prevent loss of data. These refresh operations waste energy and degrade system performance by interfering with memory accesses. The negative effects of DRAM refresh increase as DRAM device capacity increases. Existing DRAM devices refresh all cells at a rate determined by the leakiest cell in the device. However, most DRAM cells can retain data for significantly longer. Therefore, many of these refreshes are unnecessary. In this paper, we propose RAIDR (Retention-Aware Intelligent DRAM Refresh), a low-cost mechanism that can identify and skip unnecessary refreshes using knowledge of cell retention times. Our key idea is to group DRAM rows into retention time bins and apply a different refresh rate to each bin. As a result, rows containing leaky cells are refreshed as frequently as normal, while most rows are refreshed less frequently. RAIDR uses Bloom filters to efficiently implement retention time bins. RAIDR requires no modification to DRAM and minimal modification to the memory controller. In an 8-core system with 32 GB DRAM, RAIDR achieves a 74.6% refresh reduction, an average DRAM power reduction of 16.1%, and an average system performance improvement of 8.6% over existing systems, at a modest storage overhead of 1.25 KB in the memory controller. RAIDR's benefits are robust to variation in DRAM system configuration, and increase as memory capacity increases.",

      "answer": "D",
      "authors": "Jamie Liu, Ben Jaiyen, Richard Veras, and Onur Mutlu",
      "context": "Dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) is the building block of modern main memory systems. DRAM cells must be periodically refreshed to prevent loss of data. These refresh operations waste energy and degrade system performance by interfering with memory accesses. The negative effects of DRAM refresh increase as DRAM device capacity increases. Existing DRAM devices refresh all cells at a rate determined by the leakiest cell in the device. However, most DRAM cells can retain data for significantly longer. Therefore, many of these refreshes are unnecessary. In this paper, we propose RAIDR (Retention-Aware Intelligent DRAM Refresh), a low-cost mechanism that can identify and skip unnecessary refreshes using knowledge of cell retention times. Our key idea is to group DRAM rows into retention time bins and apply a different refresh rate to each bin. As a result, rows containing leaky cells are refreshed as frequently as normal, while most rows are refreshed less frequently. RAIDR uses Bloom filters to efficiently implement retention time bins. RAIDR requires no modification to DRAM and minimal modification to the memory controller. In an 8-core system with 32 GB DRAM, RAIDR achieves a 74.6% refresh reduction, an average DRAM power reduction of 16.1%, and an average system performance improvement of 8.6% over existing systems, at a modest storage overhead of 1.25 KB in the memory controller. RAIDR's benefits are robust to variation in DRAM system configuration, and increase as memory capacity increases.",
      "question": "One challenge with existing DRAM refresh mechanisms is that they refresh all cells based on ____ in the device.\nA) the average cell\nB) the fastest cell\nC) the largest cell\nD) the leakiest cell",

      "answer": "A",
      "authors": "Jamie Liu, Ben Jaiyen, Richard Veras, and Onur Mutlu",
      "context": "Dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) is the building block of modern main memory systems. DRAM cells must be periodically refreshed to prevent loss of data. These refresh operations waste energy and degrade system performance by interfering with memory accesses. The negative effects of DRAM refresh increase as DRAM device capacity increases. Existing DRAM devices refresh all cells at a rate determined by the leakiest cell in the device. However, most DRAM cells can retain data for significantly longer. Therefore, many of these refreshes are unnecessary. In this paper, we propose RAIDR (Retention-Aware Intelligent DRAM Refresh), a low-cost mechanism that can identify and skip unnecessary refreshes using knowledge of cell retention times. Our key idea is to group DRAM rows into retention time bins and apply a different refresh rate to each bin. As a result, rows containing leaky cells are refreshed as frequently as normal, while most rows are refreshed less frequently. RAIDR uses Bloom filters to efficiently implement retention time bins. RAIDR requires no modification to DRAM and minimal modification to the memory controller. In an 8-core system with 32 GB DRAM, RAIDR achieves a 74.6% refresh reduction, an average DRAM power reduction of 16.1%, and an average system performance improvement of 8.6% over existing systems, at a modest storage overhead of 1.25 KB in the memory controller. RAIDR's benefits are robust to variation in DRAM system configuration, and increase as memory capacity increases.",

      "answer": "B",
      "authors": "Jamie Liu, Ben Jaiyen, Richard Veras, and Onur Mutlu",
      "context": "Dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) is the building block of modern main memory systems. DRAM cells must be periodically refreshed to prevent loss of data. These refresh operations waste energy and degrade system performance by interfering with memory accesses. The negative effects of DRAM refresh increase as DRAM device capacity increases. Existing DRAM devices refresh all cells at a rate determined by the leakiest cell in the device. However, most DRAM cells can retain data for significantly longer. Therefore, many of these refreshes are unnecessary. In this paper, we propose RAIDR (Retention-Aware Intelligent DRAM Refresh), a low-cost mechanism that can identify and skip unnecessary refreshes using knowledge of cell retention times. Our key idea is to group DRAM rows into retention time bins and apply a different refresh rate to each bin. As a result, rows containing leaky cells are refreshed as frequently as normal, while most rows are refreshed less frequently. RAIDR uses Bloom filters to efficiently implement retention time bins. RAIDR requires no modification to DRAM and minimal modification to the memory controller. In an 8-core system with 32 GB DRAM, RAIDR achieves a 74.6% refresh reduction, an average DRAM power reduction of 16.1%, and an average system performance improvement of 8.6% over existing systems, at a modest storage overhead of 1.25 KB in the memory controller. RAIDR's benefits are robust to variation in DRAM system configuration, and increase as memory capacity increases.",

      "answer": "C",
      "authors": "Sang-Woo Jun, Andy Wright, Sizhuo Zhang, Shuotao Xu, and Arvind",
      "context": "We describe GraFBoost, a flash-based architecture with hardware acceleration for external analytics of multi-terabyte graphs. We compare the performance of GraFBoost with 1 GB of DRAM against various state-of-the-art graph analytics software including FlashGraph, running on a 32-thread Xeon server with 128 GB of DRAM. We demonstrate that despite the relatively small amount of DRAM, GraFBoost achieves high performance with very large graphs no other system can handle, and rivals the performance of the fastest software platforms on sizes of graphs that existing platforms can handle. Unlike in-memory and semi-external systems, GraFBoost uses a constant amount of memory for all problems, and its performance decreases very slowly as graph sizes increase, allowing GraFBoost to scale to much larger problems than possible with existing systems while using much less resources on a single-node system. The key component of GraFBoost is the sort-reduce accelerator, which implements a novel method to sequentialize fine-grained random accesses to flash storage. The sort-reduce accelerator logs random update requests and then uses hardware-accelerated external sorting with interleaved reduction functions. GraFBoost also stores newly updated vertex values generated in each superstep of the algorithm lazily with the old vertex values to further reduce I/O traffic. We evaluate the performance of GraFBoost for PageRank, breadth-first search and betweenness centrality on our FPGA-based prototype (Xilinx VC707 with 1 GB DRAM and 1 TB flash) and compare it to other graph processing systems including a pure software implementation of GrapFBoost.",
      "question": "One architectural advantage of systems using a constant amount of memory regardless of problem size is ____.\nA) reduced initial setup complexity for smaller graphs\nB) increased parallelism through additional cores\nC) scalability to much larger problems with limited resources\nD) improved energy efficiency due to minimized idle states",

      "context": "We describe GraFBoost, a flash-based architecture with hardware acceleration for external analytics of multi-terabyte graphs. We compare the performance of GraFBoost with 1 GB of DRAM against various state-of-the-art graph analytics software including FlashGraph, running on a 32-thread Xeon server with 128 GB of DRAM. We demonstrate that despite the relatively small amount of DRAM, GraFBoost achieves high performance with very large graphs no other system can handle, and rivals the performance of the fastest software platforms on sizes of graphs that existing platforms can handle. Unlike in-memory and semi-external systems, GraFBoost uses a constant amount of memory for all problems, and its performance decreases very slowly as graph sizes increase, allowing GraFBoost to scale to much larger problems than possible with existing systems while using much less resources on a single-node system. The key component of GraFBoost is the sort-reduce accelerator, which implements a novel method to sequentialize fine-grained random accesses to flash storage. The sort-reduce accelerator logs random update requests and then uses hardware-accelerated external sorting with interleaved reduction functions. GraFBoost also stores newly updated vertex values generated in each superstep of the algorithm lazily with the old vertex values to further reduce I/O traffic. We evaluate the performance of GraFBoost for PageRank, breadth-first search and betweenness centrality on our FPGA-based prototype (Xilinx VC707 with 1 GB DRAM and 1 TB flash) and compare it to other graph processing systems including a pure software implementation of GrapFBoost.",

      "context": "We describe GraFBoost, a flash-based architecture with hardware acceleration for external analytics of multi-terabyte graphs. We compare the performance of GraFBoost with 1 GB of DRAM against various state-of-the-art graph analytics software including FlashGraph, running on a 32-thread Xeon server with 128 GB of DRAM. We demonstrate that despite the relatively small amount of DRAM, GraFBoost achieves high performance with very large graphs no other system can handle, and rivals the performance of the fastest software platforms on sizes of graphs that existing platforms can handle. Unlike in-memory and semi-external systems, GraFBoost uses a constant amount of memory for all problems, and its performance decreases very slowly as graph sizes increase, allowing GraFBoost to scale to much larger problems than possible with existing systems while using much less resources on a single-node system. The key component of GraFBoost is the sort-reduce accelerator, which implements a novel method to sequentialize fine-grained random accesses to flash storage. The sort-reduce accelerator logs random update requests and then uses hardware-accelerated external sorting with interleaved reduction functions. GraFBoost also stores newly updated vertex values generated in each superstep of the algorithm lazily with the old vertex values to further reduce I/O traffic. We evaluate the performance of GraFBoost for PageRank, breadth-first search and betweenness centrality on our FPGA-based prototype (Xilinx VC707 with 1 GB DRAM and 1 TB flash) and compare it to other graph processing systems including a pure software implementation of GrapFBoost.",

      "answer": "A",
      "authors": "Sang-Woo Jun, Andy Wright, Sizhuo Zhang, Shuotao Xu, and Arvind",
      "context": "We describe GraFBoost, a flash-based architecture with hardware acceleration for external analytics of multi-terabyte graphs. We compare the performance of GraFBoost with 1 GB of DRAM against various state-of-the-art graph analytics software including FlashGraph, running on a 32-thread Xeon server with 128 GB of DRAM. We demonstrate that despite the relatively small amount of DRAM, GraFBoost achieves high performance with very large graphs no other system can handle, and rivals the performance of the fastest software platforms on sizes of graphs that existing platforms can handle. Unlike in-memory and semi-external systems, GraFBoost uses a constant amount of memory for all problems, and its performance decreases very slowly as graph sizes increase, allowing GraFBoost to scale to much larger problems than possible with existing systems while using much less resources on a single-node system. The key component of GraFBoost is the sort-reduce accelerator, which implements a novel method to sequentialize fine-grained random accesses to flash storage. The sort-reduce accelerator logs random update requests and then uses hardware-accelerated external sorting with interleaved reduction functions. GraFBoost also stores newly updated vertex values generated in each superstep of the algorithm lazily with the old vertex values to further reduce I/O traffic. We evaluate the performance of GraFBoost for PageRank, breadth-first search and betweenness centrality on our FPGA-based prototype (Xilinx VC707 with 1 GB DRAM and 1 TB flash) and compare it to other graph processing systems including a pure software implementation of GrapFBoost.",
      "question": "For external graph analytics on multi-terabyte datasets, performance scalability is primarily limited by ____.\nA) the efficiency of I/O operations\nB) the number of CPU cores\nC) the DRAM capacity\nD) the complexity of the graph algorithm",

      "context": "Branch prediction has enabled microprocessors to increase instruction level parallelism (ILP) by allowing programs to speculatively execute beyond control boundaries. Although speculative execution is essential for increasing the instructions per cycle (IPC), it does come at a cost. A large amount of unnecessary work results from wrong-path instructions entering the pipeline due to branch misprediction. Results generated with the SimpleScalar tool set using a 4-way issue pipeline and various branch predictors show an instruction overhead of 16% to 105% for event instruction committed. The instruction overhead will increase in the future as processors use more aggressive speculation and wider issue widths. In this paper we present an innovative method for power reduction ,which, unlike previous work that sacrificed flexibility or performance reduces power in high-performance microprocessors without impacting performance. In particular we introduce a hardware mechanism called pipeline gating to control rampant speculation in the pipeline. We present inexpensive mechanisms for determining when a branch is likely to mispredict, and for stopping wrong-path instructions from entering the pipeline. Results show up to a 38% reduction in wrong-path instructions with a negligible performance loss (/spl ap/1%). Best of all, even in programs with a high branch prediction accuracy, performance does not noticeable degrade. Our analysis indicates that there is little risk in implementing this method in existing processors since it does not impact performance and can benefit energy reduction.",

      "context": "Branch prediction has enabled microprocessors to increase instruction level parallelism (ILP) by allowing programs to speculatively execute beyond control boundaries. Although speculative execution is essential for increasing the instructions per cycle (IPC), it does come at a cost. A large amount of unnecessary work results from wrong-path instructions entering the pipeline due to branch misprediction. Results generated with the SimpleScalar tool set using a 4-way issue pipeline and various branch predictors show an instruction overhead of 16% to 105% for event instruction committed. The instruction overhead will increase in the future as processors use more aggressive speculation and wider issue widths. In this paper we present an innovative method for power reduction ,which, unlike previous work that sacrificed flexibility or performance reduces power in high-performance microprocessors without impacting performance. In particular we introduce a hardware mechanism called pipeline gating to control rampant speculation in the pipeline. We present inexpensive mechanisms for determining when a branch is likely to mispredict, and for stopping wrong-path instructions from entering the pipeline. Results show up to a 38% reduction in wrong-path instructions with a negligible performance loss (/spl ap/1%). Best of all, even in programs with a high branch prediction accuracy, performance does not noticeable degrade. Our analysis indicates that there is little risk in implementing this method in existing processors since it does not impact performance and can benefit energy reduction.",

      "context": "Branch prediction has enabled microprocessors to increase instruction level parallelism (ILP) by allowing programs to speculatively execute beyond control boundaries. Although speculative execution is essential for increasing the instructions per cycle (IPC), it does come at a cost. A large amount of unnecessary work results from wrong-path instructions entering the pipeline due to branch misprediction. Results generated with the SimpleScalar tool set using a 4-way issue pipeline and various branch predictors show an instruction overhead of 16% to 105% for event instruction committed. The instruction overhead will increase in the future as processors use more aggressive speculation and wider issue widths. In this paper we present an innovative method for power reduction ,which, unlike previous work that sacrificed flexibility or performance reduces power in high-performance microprocessors without impacting performance. In particular we introduce a hardware mechanism called pipeline gating to control rampant speculation in the pipeline. We present inexpensive mechanisms for determining when a branch is likely to mispredict, and for stopping wrong-path instructions from entering the pipeline. Results show up to a 38% reduction in wrong-path instructions with a negligible performance loss (/spl ap/1%). Best of all, even in programs with a high branch prediction accuracy, performance does not noticeable degrade. Our analysis indicates that there is little risk in implementing this method in existing processors since it does not impact performance and can benefit energy reduction.",

      "authors": "Srilatha Manne, Artur Klauser, and Dirk Grunwald",
      "context": "Branch prediction has enabled microprocessors to increase instruction level parallelism (ILP) by allowing programs to speculatively execute beyond control boundaries. Although speculative execution is essential for increasing the instructions per cycle (IPC), it does come at a cost. A large amount of unnecessary work results from wrong-path instructions entering the pipeline due to branch misprediction. Results generated with the SimpleScalar tool set using a 4-way issue pipeline and various branch predictors show an instruction overhead of 16% to 105% for event instruction committed. The instruction overhead will increase in the future as processors use more aggressive speculation and wider issue widths. In this paper we present an innovative method for power reduction ,which, unlike previous work that sacrificed flexibility or performance reduces power in high-performance microprocessors without impacting performance. In particular we introduce a hardware mechanism called pipeline gating to control rampant speculation in the pipeline. We present inexpensive mechanisms for determining when a branch is likely to mispredict, and for stopping wrong-path instructions from entering the pipeline. Results show up to a 38% reduction in wrong-path instructions with a negligible performance loss (/spl ap/1%). Best of all, even in programs with a high branch prediction accuracy, performance does not noticeable degrade. Our analysis indicates that there is little risk in implementing this method in existing processors since it does not impact performance and can benefit energy reduction.",

      "context": "Commercial applications such as databases and Web servers constitute the largest and fastest-growing segment of the market for multiprocessor servers. Ongoing innovations in disk subsystems, along with the ever increasing gap between processor and memory speeds, have elevated memory system design as the critical performance factor for such workloads. However, most current server designs have been optimized to perform well on scientific and engineering workloads, potentially leading to design decisions that are non-ideal for commercial applications. The above problem is exacerbated by the lack of information on the performance requirements of commercial workloads, the lack of available applications for widespread study, and the fact that most representative applications are too large and complex to serve as suitable benchmarks for evaluating trade-offs in the design of processors and servers.This paper presents a detailed performance study of three important classes of commercial workloads: online transaction processing (OLTP), decision support systems (DSS), and Web index search. We use the Oracle commercial database engine for our OLTP and DSS workloads, and the AltaVista search engine for our Web index search workload. This study characterizes the memory system behavior of these workloads through a large number of architectural experiments on Alpha multiprocessors augmented with full system simulations to determine the impact of architectural trends. We also identify a set of simplifications that make these workloads more amenable to monitoring and simulation without affecting representative memory system behavior. We observe that systems optimized for OLTP versus DSS and index search workloads may lead to diverging designs, specifically in the size and speed requirements for off-chip caches.",

      "context": "Commercial applications such as databases and Web servers constitute the largest and fastest-growing segment of the market for multiprocessor servers. Ongoing innovations in disk subsystems, along with the ever increasing gap between processor and memory speeds, have elevated memory system design as the critical performance factor for such workloads. However, most current server designs have been optimized to perform well on scientific and engineering workloads, potentially leading to design decisions that are non-ideal for commercial applications. The above problem is exacerbated by the lack of information on the performance requirements of commercial workloads, the lack of available applications for widespread study, and the fact that most representative applications are too large and complex to serve as suitable benchmarks for evaluating trade-offs in the design of processors and servers.This paper presents a detailed performance study of three important classes of commercial workloads: online transaction processing (OLTP), decision support systems (DSS), and Web index search. We use the Oracle commercial database engine for our OLTP and DSS workloads, and the AltaVista search engine for our Web index search workload. This study characterizes the memory system behavior of these workloads through a large number of architectural experiments on Alpha multiprocessors augmented with full system simulations to determine the impact of architectural trends. We also identify a set of simplifications that make these workloads more amenable to monitoring and simulation without affecting representative memory system behavior. We observe that systems optimized for OLTP versus DSS and index search workloads may lead to diverging designs, specifically in the size and speed requirements for off-chip caches.",

      "context": "Commercial applications such as databases and Web servers constitute the largest and fastest-growing segment of the market for multiprocessor servers. Ongoing innovations in disk subsystems, along with the ever increasing gap between processor and memory speeds, have elevated memory system design as the critical performance factor for such workloads. However, most current server designs have been optimized to perform well on scientific and engineering workloads, potentially leading to design decisions that are non-ideal for commercial applications. The above problem is exacerbated by the lack of information on the performance requirements of commercial workloads, the lack of available applications for widespread study, and the fact that most representative applications are too large and complex to serve as suitable benchmarks for evaluating trade-offs in the design of processors and servers.This paper presents a detailed performance study of three important classes of commercial workloads: online transaction processing (OLTP), decision support systems (DSS), and Web index search. We use the Oracle commercial database engine for our OLTP and DSS workloads, and the AltaVista search engine for our Web index search workload. This study characterizes the memory system behavior of these workloads through a large number of architectural experiments on Alpha multiprocessors augmented with full system simulations to determine the impact of architectural trends. We also identify a set of simplifications that make these workloads more amenable to monitoring and simulation without affecting representative memory system behavior. We observe that systems optimized for OLTP versus DSS and index search workloads may lead to diverging designs, specifically in the size and speed requirements for off-chip caches.",

      "context": "Commercial applications such as databases and Web servers constitute the largest and fastest-growing segment of the market for multiprocessor servers. Ongoing innovations in disk subsystems, along with the ever increasing gap between processor and memory speeds, have elevated memory system design as the critical performance factor for such workloads. However, most current server designs have been optimized to perform well on scientific and engineering workloads, potentially leading to design decisions that are non-ideal for commercial applications. The above problem is exacerbated by the lack of information on the performance requirements of commercial workloads, the lack of available applications for widespread study, and the fact that most representative applications are too large and complex to serve as suitable benchmarks for evaluating trade-offs in the design of processors and servers.This paper presents a detailed performance study of three important classes of commercial workloads: online transaction processing (OLTP), decision support systems (DSS), and Web index search. We use the Oracle commercial database engine for our OLTP and DSS workloads, and the AltaVista search engine for our Web index search workload. This study characterizes the memory system behavior of these workloads through a large number of architectural experiments on Alpha multiprocessors augmented with full system simulations to determine the impact of architectural trends. We also identify a set of simplifications that make these workloads more amenable to monitoring and simulation without affecting representative memory system behavior. We observe that systems optimized for OLTP versus DSS and index search workloads may lead to diverging designs, specifically in the size and speed requirements for off-chip caches.",

      "context": "Commercial applications such as databases and Web servers constitute the largest and fastest-growing segment of the market for multiprocessor servers. Ongoing innovations in disk subsystems, along with the ever increasing gap between processor and memory speeds, have elevated memory system design as the critical performance factor for such workloads. However, most current server designs have been optimized to perform well on scientific and engineering workloads, potentially leading to design decisions that are non-ideal for commercial applications. The above problem is exacerbated by the lack of information on the performance requirements of commercial workloads, the lack of available applications for widespread study, and the fact that most representative applications are too large and complex to serve as suitable benchmarks for evaluating trade-offs in the design of processors and servers.This paper presents a detailed performance study of three important classes of commercial workloads: online transaction processing (OLTP), decision support systems (DSS), and Web index search. We use the Oracle commercial database engine for our OLTP and DSS workloads, and the AltaVista search engine for our Web index search workload. This study characterizes the memory system behavior of these workloads through a large number of architectural experiments on Alpha multiprocessors augmented with full system simulations to determine the impact of architectural trends. We also identify a set of simplifications that make these workloads more amenable to monitoring and simulation without affecting representative memory system behavior. We observe that systems optimized for OLTP versus DSS and index search workloads may lead to diverging designs, specifically in the size and speed requirements for off-chip caches.",

Techniques to do in-situ arithmetic in SRAM arrays, create efficient data mapping and reducing data movement are proposed. The Neural Cache architecture is capable of fully executing convolutional, fully connected, and pooling layers in-cache. The proposed architecture also supports quantization in-cache. Our experimental results show that the proposed architecture can improve inference latency by 8.3\u00d7 over state-of-art multi-core CPU (Xeon E5), 7.7\u00d7 over server class GPU (Titan Xp), for Inception v3 model. Neural Cache improves inference throughput by 12.4\u00d7 over CPU (2.2\u00d7 over GPU), while reducing power consumption by 50% over CPU (53% over GPU).",

Techniques to do in-situ arithmetic in SRAM arrays, create efficient data mapping and reducing data movement are proposed. The Neural Cache architecture is capable of fully executing convolutional, fully connected, and pooling layers in-cache. The proposed architecture also supports quantization in-cache. Our experimental results show that the proposed architecture can improve inference latency by 8.3\u00d7 over state-of-art multi-core CPU (Xeon E5), 7.7\u00d7 over server class GPU (Titan Xp), for Inception v3 model. Neural Cache improves inference throughput by 12.4\u00d7 over CPU (2.2\u00d7 over GPU), while reducing power consumption by 50% over CPU (53% over GPU).",

      "context": "Single-ISA heterogeneous multi-core processors are typically composed of small (e.g., in-order) power-efficient cores and big (e.g., out-of-order) high-performance cores. The effectiveness of heterogeneous multi-cores depends on how well a scheduler can map workloads onto the most appropriate core type. In general, small cores can achieve good performance if the workload inherently has high levels of ILP. On the other hand, big cores provide good performance if the workload exhibits high levels of MLP or requires the ILP to be extracted dynamically. This paper proposes Performance Impact Estimation (PIE) as a mechanism to predict which workload-to-core mapping is likely to provide the best performance. PIE collects CPI stack, MLP and ILP profile information, and estimates performance if the workload were to run on a different core type. Dynamic PIE adjusts the scheduling at runtime and thereby exploits fine-grained time-varying execution behavior. We show that PIE requires limited hardware support and can improve system performance by an average of 5.5% over recent state-of-the-art scheduling proposals and by 8.7% over a sampling-based scheduling policy.",

The effectiveness of heterogeneous multi-cores depends on how well a scheduler can map workloads onto the most appropriate core type. In general, small cores can achieve good performance if the workload inherently has high levels of ILP. On the other hand, big cores provide good performance if the workload exhibits high levels of MLP or requires the ILP to be extracted dynamically. This paper proposes Performance Impact Estimation (PIE) as a mechanism to predict which workload-to-core mapping is likely to provide the best performance. PIE collects CPI stack, MLP and ILP profile information, and estimates performance if the workload were to run on a different core type. Dynamic PIE adjusts the scheduling at runtime and thereby exploits fine-grained time-varying execution behavior. We show that PIE requires limited hardware support and can improve system performance by an average of 5.5% over recent state-of-the-art scheduling proposals and by 8.7% over a sampling-based scheduling policy.",

The effectiveness of heterogeneous multi-cores depends on how well a scheduler can map workloads onto the most appropriate core type. In general, small cores can achieve good performance if the workload inherently has high levels of ILP. On the other hand, big cores provide good performance if the workload exhibits high levels of MLP or requires the ILP to be extracted dynamically. This paper proposes Performance Impact Estimation (PIE) as a mechanism to predict which workload-to-core mapping is likely to provide the best performance. PIE collects CPI stack, MLP and ILP profile information, and estimates performance if the workload were to run on a different core type. Dynamic PIE adjusts the scheduling at runtime and thereby exploits fine-grained time-varying execution behavior. We show that PIE requires limited hardware support and can improve system performance by an average of 5.5% over recent state-of-the-art scheduling proposals and by 8.7% over a sampling-based scheduling policy.",

      "context": "GPU and FPGA-based clouds have already demonstrated the promise of accelerating computing-intensive workloads with greatly improved power and performance. In this paper, we examine the design of ASIC Clouds, which are purpose-built datacenters comprised of large arrays of ASIC accelerators, whose purpose is to optimize the total cost of ownership (TCO) of large, high-volume chronic computations, which are becoming increasingly common as more and more services are built around the Cloud model. On the surface, the creation of ASIC clouds may seem highlyimprobable due to high NREs and the inflexibility of ASICs. Surprisingly, however, large-scale ASIC Clouds have already been deployed by a large number of commercial entities, to implement the distributed Bitcoin cryptocurrency system. We begin with a case study of Bitcoin mining ASIC Clouds, which are perhaps the largest ASIC Clouds to date. From there, we design three more ASIC Clouds, including a YouTube-style video transcoding ASIC Cloud, a Litecoin ASIC Cloud, and a Convolutional Neural Network ASIC Cloud and show 2-3 orders of magnitude better TCO versus CPU and GPU. Among our contributions, we present a methodology that given an accelerator design, derives Pareto-optimal ASIC Cloud Servers, by extracting data from place-and-routed circuits and computational fluid dynamic simulations, and then employing clever but brute-force search to find the best jointly-optimized ASIC, DRAM subsystem, motherboard, power delivery system, cooling system, operating voltage, and case design. Moreover, we show how data center parameters determine which of the many Pareto-optimal points is TCO-optimal. Finally we examine when it makes sense to build an ASIC Cloud, and examine the impact of ASIC NRE.",

      "context": "GPU and FPGA-based clouds have already demonstrated the promise of accelerating computing-intensive workloads with greatly improved power and performance. In this paper, we examine the design of ASIC Clouds, which are purpose-built datacenters comprised of large arrays of ASIC accelerators, whose purpose is to optimize the total cost of ownership (TCO) of large, high-volume chronic computations, which are becoming increasingly common as more and more services are built around the Cloud model. On the surface, the creation of ASIC clouds may seem highlyimprobable due to high NREs and the inflexibility of ASICs. Surprisingly, however, large-scale ASIC Clouds have already been deployed by a large number of commercial entities, to implement the distributed Bitcoin cryptocurrency system. We begin with a case study of Bitcoin mining ASIC Clouds, which are perhaps the largest ASIC Clouds to date. From there, we design three more ASIC Clouds, including a YouTube-style video transcoding ASIC Cloud, a Litecoin ASIC Cloud, and a Convolutional Neural Network ASIC Cloud and show 2-3 orders of magnitude better TCO versus CPU and GPU. Among our contributions, we present a methodology that given an accelerator design, derives Pareto-optimal ASIC Cloud Servers, by extracting data from place-and-routed circuits and computational fluid dynamic simulations, and then employing clever but brute-force search to find the best jointly-optimized ASIC, DRAM subsystem, motherboard, power delivery system, cooling system, operating voltage, and case design. Moreover, we show how data center parameters determine which of the many Pareto-optimal points is TCO-optimal. Finally we examine when it makes sense to build an ASIC Cloud, and examine the impact of ASIC NRE.",

In this paper, we examine the design of ASIC Clouds, which are purpose-built datacenters comprised of large arrays of ASIC accelerators, whose purpose is to optimize the total cost of ownership (TCO) of large, high-volume chronic computations, which are becoming increasingly common as more and more services are built around the Cloud model. On the surface, the creation of ASIC clouds may seem highlyimprobable due to high NREs and the inflexibility of ASICs. Surprisingly, however, large-scale ASIC Clouds have already been deployed by a large number of commercial entities, to implement the distributed Bitcoin cryptocurrency system. We begin with a case study of Bitcoin mining ASIC Clouds, which are perhaps the largest ASIC Clouds to date. From there, we design three more ASIC Clouds, including a YouTube-style video transcoding ASIC Cloud, a Litecoin ASIC Cloud, and a Convolutional Neural Network ASIC Cloud and show 2-3 orders of magnitude better TCO versus CPU and GPU. Among our contributions, we present a methodology that given an accelerator design, derives Pareto-optimal ASIC Cloud Servers, by extracting data from place-and-routed circuits and computational fluid dynamic simulations, and then employing clever but brute-force search to find the best jointly-optimized ASIC, DRAM subsystem, motherboard, power delivery system, cooling system, operating voltage, and case design. Moreover, we show how data center parameters determine which of the many Pareto-optimal points is TCO-optimal.

      "context": "GPU and FPGA-based clouds have already demonstrated the promise of accelerating computing-intensive workloads with greatly improved power and performance. In this paper, we examine the design of ASIC Clouds, which are purpose-built datacenters comprised of large arrays of ASIC accelerators, whose purpose is to optimize the total cost of ownership (TCO) of large, high-volume chronic computations, which are becoming increasingly common as more and more services are built around the Cloud model. On the surface, the creation of ASIC clouds may seem highlyimprobable due to high NREs and the inflexibility of ASICs. Surprisingly, however, large-scale ASIC Clouds have already been deployed by a large number of commercial entities, to implement the distributed Bitcoin cryptocurrency system. We begin with a case study of Bitcoin mining ASIC Clouds, which are perhaps the largest ASIC Clouds to date. From there, we design three more ASIC Clouds, including a YouTube-style video transcoding ASIC Cloud, a Litecoin ASIC Cloud, and a Convolutional Neural Network ASIC Cloud and show 2-3 orders of magnitude better TCO versus CPU and GPU. Among our contributions, we present a methodology that given an accelerator design, derives Pareto-optimal ASIC Cloud Servers, by extracting data from place-and-routed circuits and computational fluid dynamic simulations, and then employing clever but brute-force search to find the best jointly-optimized ASIC, DRAM subsystem, motherboard, power delivery system, cooling system, operating voltage, and case design. Moreover, we show how data center parameters determine which of the many Pareto-optimal points is TCO-optimal. Finally we examine when it makes sense to build an ASIC Cloud, and examine the impact of ASIC NRE.",
      "question": "The feasibility of ASIC clouds for specific applications is primarily determined by:\nA) The current market price of Bitcoin, which drives demand for ASIC cloud infrastructure.\nB) The availability of pre-designed ASICs for common tasks like video transcoding and neural networks.\nC) The ease of integrating ASICs with existing data center infrastructure.\nD) The balance between the high NRE cost of ASIC design and the long-term operational cost savings for sufficiently high-volume computations.",

      "context": "Three-dimensional integration enables stacking memory directly on top of a microprocessor, thereby significantly reducing wire delay between the two. Previous studies have examined the performance benefits of such an approach, but all of these works only consider commodity 2D DRAM organizations. In this work, we explore more aggressive 3D DRAM organizations that make better use of the additional die-to-die bandwidth provided by 3D stacking, as well as the additional transistor count. Our simulation results show that with a few simple changes to the 3D-DRAM organization, we can achieve a 1.75x speedup over previously proposed 3D-DRAM approaches on our memory-intensive multi-programmed workloads on a quad-core processor. The significant increase in memory system performance makes the L2 miss handling architecture (MHA) a new bottleneck, which we address by combining a novel data structure called the Vector Bloom Filter with dynamic MSHR capacity tuning. Our scalable L2 MHA yields an additional 17.8% performance improvement over our 3D-stacked memory architecture.",

      "context": "Three-dimensional integration enables stacking memory directly on top of a microprocessor, thereby significantly reducing wire delay between the two. Previous studies have examined the performance benefits of such an approach, but all of these works only consider commodity 2D DRAM organizations. In this work, we explore more aggressive 3D DRAM organizations that make better use of the additional die-to-die bandwidth provided by 3D stacking, as well as the additional transistor count. Our simulation results show that with a few simple changes to the 3D-DRAM organization, we can achieve a 1.75x speedup over previously proposed 3D-DRAM approaches on our memory-intensive multi-programmed workloads on a quad-core processor. The significant increase in memory system performance makes the L2 miss handling architecture (MHA) a new bottleneck, which we address by combining a novel data structure called the Vector Bloom Filter with dynamic MSHR capacity tuning. Our scalable L2 MHA yields an additional 17.8% performance improvement over our 3D-stacked memory architecture.",

      "context": "In recent years, neural network accelerators have been shown to achieve both high energy efficiency and high performance for a broad application scope within the important category of recognition and mining applications. Still, both the energy efficiency and performance of such accelerators remain limited by memory accesses. In this paper, we focus on image applications, arguably the most important category among recognition and mining applications. The neural networks which are state-of-the-art for these applications are Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and they have an important property: weights are shared among many neurons, considerably reducing the neural network memory footprint. This property allows to entirely map a CNN within an SRAM, eliminating all DRAM accesses for weights. By further hoisting this accelerator next to the image sensor, it is possible to eliminate all remaining DRAM accesses, i.e., for inputs and outputs. In this paper, we propose such a CNN accelerator, placed next to a CMOS or CCD sensor. The absence of DRAM accesses combined with a careful exploitation of the specific data access patterns within CNNs allows us to design an accelerator which is 60&times more energy efficient than the previous state-of-the-art neural network accelerator. We present a full design down to the layout at 65 nm, with a modest footprint of 4.86mm2 and consuming only 320mW, but still about 30\u00d7 faster than high-end GPUs.",

      "context": "With the increasing prevalence of warehouse-scale (WSC) and cloud computing, understanding the interactions of server applications with the underlying microarchitecture becomes ever more important in order to extract maximum performance out of server hardware. To aid such understanding, this paper presents a detailed microarchitectural analysis of live datacenter jobs, measured on more than 20,000 Google machines over a three year period, and comprising thousands of different applications. We first find that WSC workloads are extremely diverse, breeding the need for architectures that can tolerate application variability without performance loss. However, some patterns emerge, offering opportunities for co-optimization of hardware and software. For example, we identify common building blocks in the lower levels of the software stack. This \"datacenter tax\" can comprise nearly 30% of cycles across jobs running in the fleet, which makes its constituents prime candidates for hardware specialization in future server systems-on-chips. We also uncover opportunities for classic microarchitectural optimizations for server processors, especially in the cache hierarchy. Typical workloads place significant stress on instruction caches and prefer memory latency over bandwidth. They also stall cores often, but compute heavily in bursts. These observations motivate several interesting directions for future warehouse-scale computers.",

The failure of Dennard scaling, to which the shift to multicore parts is partially a response, may soon limit multicore scaling just as single-core scaling has been curtailed. This paper models multicore scaling limits by combining device scaling, single-core scaling, and multicore scaling to measure the speedup potential for a set of parallel workloads for the next five technology generations. For device scaling, we use both the ITRS projections and a set of more conservative device scaling parameters. To model single-core scaling, we combine measurements from over 150 processors to derive Pareto-optimal frontiers for area/performance and power/performance. Finally, to model multicore scaling, we build a detailed performance model of upper-bound performance and lower-bound core power. The multicore designs we study include single-threaded CPU-like and massively threaded GPU-like multicore chip organizations with symmetric, asymmetric, dynamic, and composed topologies. The study shows that regardless of chip organization and topology, multicore scaling is power limited to a degree not widely appreciated by the computing community. Even at 22 nm (just one year from now), 21% of a fixed-size chip must be powered off, and at 8 nm, this number grows to more than 50%.

      "context": "Evolving technology and increasing pin-bandwidth motivate the use of high-radix routers to reduce the diameter, latency, and cost of interconnection networks. High-radix networks, however, require longer cables than their low-radix counterparts. Because cables dominate network cost, the number of cables, and particularly the number of long, global cables should be minimized to realize an efficient network. In this paper, we introduce the dragonfly topology which uses a group of high-radix routers as a virtual router to increase the effective radix of the network. With this organization, each minimally routed packet traverses at most one global channel. By reducing global channels, a dragonfly reduces cost by 20% compared to a flattened butterfly and by 52% compared to a folded Clos network in configurations with \u2265 16K nodes.We also introduce two new variants of global adaptive routing that enable load-balanced routing in the dragonfly. Each router in a dragonfly must make an adaptive routing decision based on the state of a global channel connected to a different router. Because of the indirect nature of this routing decision, conventional adaptive routing algorithms give degraded performance. We introduce the use of selective virtual-channel discrimination and the use of credit round-trip latency to both sense and signal channel congestion. The combination of these two methods gives throughput and latency that approaches that of an ideal adaptive routing algorithm.",

      "answer": "A",
      "authors": "Jamie Liu, Ben Jaiyen, Yoongu Kim, Chris Wilkerson, and Onur Mutlu",
      "context": "DRAM cells store data in the form of charge on a capacitor. This charge leaks off over time, eventually causing data to be lost. To prevent this data loss from occurring, DRAM cells must be periodically refreshed. Unfortunately, DRAM refresh operations waste energy and also degrade system performance by interfering with memory requests. These problems are expected to worsen as DRAM density increases. The amount of time that a DRAM cell can safely retain data without being refreshed is called the cell's retention time. In current systems, all DRAM cells are refreshed at the rate required to guarantee the integrity of the cell with the shortest retention time, resulting in unnecessary refreshes for cells with longer retention times. Prior work has proposed to reduce unnecessary refreshes by exploiting differences in retention time among DRAM cells; however, such mechanisms require knowledge of each cell's retention time. In this paper, we present a comprehensive quantitative study of retention behavior in modern DRAMs. Using a temperature-controlled FPGA-based testing platform, we collect retention time information from 248 commodity DDR3 DRAM chips from five major DRAM vendors. We observe two significant phenomena: data pattern dependence, where the retention time of each DRAM cell is significantly affected by the data stored in other DRAM cells, and variable retention time, where the retention time of some DRAM cells changes unpredictably over time. We discuss possible physical explanations for these phenomena, how their magnitude may be affected by DRAM technology scaling, and their ramifications for DRAM retention time profiling mechanisms.",
      "question": "The study's findings suggest that future DRAM refresh schemes will likely need to account for ____ to maximize efficiency.\nA) both data pattern dependence and variable retention time within individual DRAM cells\nB) solely the shortest retention time among all DRAM cells on a chip\nC) average retention time across all DRAM cells from a given vendor\nD) temperature variations across the DRAM module",

      "context": "Datacenter workloads demand high computational capabilities, flexibility, power efficiency, and low cost. It is challenging to improve all of these factors simultaneously. To advance datacenter capabilities beyond what commodity server designs can provide, we have designed and built a composable, reconfigurablefabric to accelerate portions of large-scale software services. Each instantiation of the fabric consists of a 6x8 2-D torus of high-end Stratix V FPGAs embedded into a half-rack of 48 machines. One FPGA is placed into each server, accessible through PCIe, and wired directly to other FPGAs with pairs of 10 Gb SAS cables. In this paper, we describe a medium-scale deployment of this fabric on a bed of 1,632 servers, and measure its efficacy in accelerating the Bing web search engine. We describe the requirements and architecture of the system, detail the critical engineering challenges and solutions needed to make the system robust in the presence of failures, and measure the performance, power, and resilience of the system when ranking candidate documents. Under high load, the largescale reconfigurable fabric improves the ranking throughput of each server by a factor of 95% for a fixed latency distribution--- or, while maintaining equivalent throughput, reduces the tail latency by 29%.",
      "question": "When accelerating specific portions of a large application, rather than the entire application, a key design consideration is ____.\nA) ensuring the accelerated portions do not bottleneck the overall application performance.\nB) selecting portions of the application that are most computationally intensive.\nC) minimizing the communication overhead between the accelerated and non-accelerated portions.\nD) carefully analyzing the application to choose the portions whose acceleration provides the greatest overall benefit while managing added complexity.",

      "title": "High Performance Cache Replacement Using Re-Reference Interval Prediction (RRIP)",
      "answer": "C",
      "authors": "Aamer Jaleel, Kevin B. Theobald, Simon C. Steely, and Joel Emer",
      "context": "Practical cache replacement policies attempt to emulate optimal replacement by predicting the re-reference interval of a cache block. The commonly used LRU replacement policy always predicts a near-immediate re-reference interval on cache hits and misses. Applications that exhibit a distant re-reference interval perform badly under LRU. Such applications usually have a working-set larger than the cache or have frequent bursts of references to non-temporal data (called scans). To improve the performance of such workloads, this paper proposes cache replacement using Re-reference Interval Prediction (RRIP). We propose Static RRIP (SRRIP) that is scan-resistant and Dynamic RRIP (DRRIP) that is both scan-resistant and thrash-resistant. Both RRIP policies require only 2-bits per cache block and easily integrate into existing LRU approximations found in modern processors. Our evaluations using PC games, multimedia, server and SPEC CPU2006 workloads on a single-core processor with a 2MB last-level cache (LLC) show that both SRRIP and DRRIP outperform LRU replacement on the throughput metric by an average of 4% and 10% respectively. Our evaluations with over 1000 multi-programmed workloads on a 4-core CMP with an 8MB shared LLC show that SRRIP and DRRIP outperform LRU replacement on the throughput metric by an average of 7% and 9% respectively. We also show that RRIP outperforms LFU, the state-of the art scan-resistant replacement algorithm to-date. For the cache configurations under study, RRIP requires 2X less hardware than LRU and 2.5X less hardware than LFU.",
      "question": "Applications with working sets larger than the cache size or those exhibiting frequent accesses to non-temporal data often experience performance degradation under traditional cache replacement policies like LRU because these policies ____.\nA) prioritize recently used data, potentially evicting data that will be needed soon.\nB) fail to adapt to changing access patterns, leading to unnecessary cache misses.\nC) implicitly assume short re-reference intervals, mispredicting the future reuse of data.\nD) increase the complexity of cache management, leading to higher hardware overhead.",

      "context": "Convolutional neural networks (CNN) applications range from recognition and reasoning (such as handwriting recognition, facial expression recognition and video surveillance) to intelligent text applications such as semantic text analysis and natural language processing applications. Two key observations drive the design of a new architecture for CNN. First, CNN workloads exhibit a widely varying mix of three types of parallelism: parallelism within a convolution operation, intra-output parallelism where multiple input sources (features) are combined to create a single output, and inter-output parallelism where multiple, independent outputs (features) are computed simultaneously. Workloads differ significantly across different CNN applications, and across different layers of a CNN. Second, the number of processing elements in an architecture continues to scale (as per Moore's law) much faster than off-chip memory bandwidth (or pin-count) of chips. Based on these two observations, we show that for a given number of processing elements and off-chip memory bandwidth, a new CNN hardware architecture that dynamically configures the hardware on-the-fly to match the specific mix of parallelism in a given workload gives the best throughput performance. Our CNN compiler automatically translates high abstraction network specification into a parallel microprogram (a sequence of low-level VLIW instructions) that is mapped, scheduled and executed by the coprocessor. Compared to a 2.3 GHz quad-core, dual socket Intel Xeon, 1.35 GHz C870 GPU, and a 200 MHz FPGA implementation, our 120 MHz dynamically configurable architecture is 4x to 8x faster. This is the first CNN architecture to achieve real-time video stream processing (25 to 30 frames per second) on a wide range of object detection and recognition tasks.",
      "question": "Given the observation that processing element counts scale faster than off-chip memory bandwidth, which design principle becomes increasingly important for CNN accelerator architectures?\nA) Maximizing clock frequency to increase the number of operations per second.\nB) Optimizing data reuse and minimizing off-chip memory accesses.\nC) Employing a fixed architecture optimized for a specific type of CNN parallelism.\nD) Prioritizing the use of large on-chip caches to store entire CNN models.",

      "context": "Ensuring the quality of service (QoS) for latency-sensitive applications while allowing co-locations of multiple applications on servers is critical for improving server utilization and reducing cost in modern warehouse-scale computers (WSCs). Recent work relies on static profiling to precisely predict the QoS degradation that results from performance interference among co-running applications to increase the number of \"safe\" co-locations. However, these static profiling techniques have several critical limitations: 1) a priori knowledge of all workloads is required for profiling, 2) it is difficult for the prediction to capture or adapt to phase or load changes of applications, and 3) the prediction technique is limited to only two co-running applications. To address all of these limitations, we present Bubble-Flux, an integrated dynamic interference measurement and online QoS management mechanism to provide accurate QoS control and maximize server utilization. Bubble-Flux uses a Dynamic Bubble to probe servers in real time to measure the instantaneous pressure on the shared hardware resources and precisely predict how the QoS of a latency-sensitive job will be affected by potential co-runners. Once \"safe\" batch jobs are selected and mapped to a server, Bubble-Flux uses an Online Flux Engine to continuously monitor the QoS of the latency-sensitive application and control the execution of batch jobs to adapt to dynamic input, phase, and load changes to deliver satisfactory QoS. Batch applications remain in a state of flux throughout execution. Our results show that the utilization improvement achieved by Bubble-Flux is up to 2.2x better than the prior static approach.",

      "answer": "C",
      "authors": "Mahmoud Khairy, Zhesheng Shen, Tor M. Aamodt, and Timothy G. Rogers",
      "context": "In computer architecture, significant innovation frequently comes from industry. However, the simulation tools used by industry are often not released for open use, and even when they are, the exact details of industrial designs are not disclosed. As a result, research in the architecture space must ensure that assumptions about contemporary processor design remain true.To help bridge the gap between opaque industrial innovation and public research, we introduce three mechanisms that make it much easier for GPU simulators to keep up with industry. First, we introduce a new GPU simulator frontend that minimizes the effort required to simulate different machine ISAs through trace-driven simulation of NVIDIA's native machine ISA, while still supporting execution-driven simulation of the virtual ISA. Second, we extensively update GPGPU-Sim's performance model to increase its level of detail, configurability and accuracy. Finally, surrounding the new frontend and flexible performance model is an infrastructure that enables quick, detailed validation. A comprehensive set of microbenchmarks and automated correlation plotting ease the modeling process.We use these three new mechanisms to build Accel-Sim, a detailed simulation framework that decreases cycle error 79 percentage points, over a wide range of 80 workloads, consisting of 1,945 kernel instances. We further demonstrate that Accel-Sim is able to simulate benchmark suites that no other open-source simulator can. In particular, we use Accel-sim to simulate an additional 60 workloads, comprised of 11,440 kernel instances, from the machine learning benchmark suite Deepbench. Deepbench makes use of closed-source, hand-tuned kernels with no virtual ISA implementation. Using a rigorous counter-by-counter analysis, we validate Accel-Sim against contemporary GPUs.Finally, to highlight the effects of falling behind industry, this paper presents two case-studies that demonstrate how incorrect baseline assumptions can hide new areas of opportunity and lead to potentially incorrect design decisions.",

      "context": "The explosion of digital data and the ever-growing need for fast data analysis have made in-memory big-data processing in computer systems increasingly important. In particular, large-scale graph processing is gaining attention due to its broad applicability from social science to machine learning. However, scalable hardware design that can efficiently process large graphs in main memory is still an open problem. Ideally, cost-effective and scalable graph processing systems can be realized by building a system whose performance increases proportionally with the sizes of graphs that can be stored in the system, which is extremely challenging in conventional systems due to severe memory bandwidth limitations. In this work, we argue that the conventional concept of processing-in-memory (PIM) can be a viable solution to achieve such an objective. The key modern enabler for PIM is the recent advancement of the 3D integration technology that facilitates stacking logic and memory dies in a single package, which was not available when the PIM concept was originally examined. In order to take advantage of such a new technology to enable memory-capacity-proportional performance, we design a programmable PIM accelerator for large-scale graph processing called Tesseract. Tesseract is composed of (1) a new hardware architecture that fully utilizes the available memory bandwidth, (2) an efficient method of communication between different memory partitions, and (3) a programming interface that reflects and exploits the unique hardware design. It also includes two hardware prefetchers specialized for memory access patterns of graph processing, which operate based on the hints provided by our programming model. Our comprehensive evaluations using five state-of-the-art graph processing workloads with large real-world graphs show that the proposed architecture improves average system performance by a factor of ten and achieves 87% average energy reduction over conventional systems.",

      "context": "Trends in VLSI technology scaling demand that future computing devices be narrowly focused to achieve high performance and high efficiency, yet also target the high volumes and low costs of widely applicable general purpose designs. To address these conflicting requirements, we propose a modular reconfigurable architecture called Smart Memories, targeted at computing needs in the 0.1 /spl mu/m technology generation. A Smart Memories chip is made up of many processing tiles, each containing local memory, local interconnect, and a processor core. For efficient computation under a wide class of possible applications, the memories, the wires, and the computational model can all be altered to match the applications. To show the applicability of this design, two very different machines at opposite ends of the architectural spectrum, the Imagine stream processor and the Hydra speculative multiprocessor, are mapped onto the Smart Memories computing substrate. Simulations of the mappings show that the Smart Memories architecture can successfully map these architectures with only modest performance degradation.",

      "context": "Effective data prefetching requires accurate mechanisms to predict both \u201cwhich\u201d cache blocks to prefetch and \u201cwhen\u201d to prefetch them. This paper proposes the Dead-Block Predictors (DBPs), trace-based predictors that accurately identify \u201cwhen\u201d an Ll data cache block becomes evictable or \u201cdead\u201d. Predicting a dead block significantly enhances prefetching lookahead and opportunity, and enables placing data directly into Ll, obviating the need for auxiliary prefetch buffers. This paper also proposes Dead-Block Correlating Prefetchers (DBCPs), that use address correlation to predict \u201cwhich\u201d subsequent block to prefetch when a block becomes evictable. A DBCP enables effective data prefetching in a wide spectrum of pointer-intensive, integer, and floating-point applications. We use cycle-accurate simulation of an out-of-order superscalar processor and memory-intensive benchmarks to show that: (1) dead-block prediction enhances prefetching lookahead at least by an order of magnitude as compared to previous techniques, (2) a DBP can predict dead blocks on average with a coverage of 90% only mispredicting 4% of the time, (3) a DBCP offers an address prediction coverage of 86% only mispredicting 3% of the time, and (4) DBCPs improve performance by 62% on average and 282% at best in the benchmarks we studied.",

      "answer": "A",
      "authors": "David Brooks, Vivek Tiwari, and Margaret Martonosi",
      "context": "Power dissipation and thermal issues are increasingly significant in modern processors. As a result, it is crucial that power/performance tradeoffs be made more visible to chip architects and even compiler writers, in addition to circuit designers. Most existing power analysis tools achieve high accuracy by calculating power estimates for designs only after layout or floorplanning are complete. In addition to being available only late in the design process, such tools are often quite slow, which compounds the difficulty of running them for a large space of design possibilities. This paper presents Wattch, a framework for analyzing and optimizing microprocessor power dissipation at the architecture-level. Wattch is 1000X or more faster than existing layout-level power tools, and yet maintains accuracy within 10% of their estimates as verified using industry tools on leading-edge designs. This paper presents several validations of Wattch's accuracy. In addition, we present three examples that demonstrate how architects or compiler writers might use Wattch to evaluate power consumption in their design process. We see Wattch as a complement to existing lower-level tools; it allows architects to explore and cull the design space early on, using faster, higher-level tools. It also opens up the field of power-efficient computing to a wider range of researchers by providing a power evaluation methodology within the portable and familiar SimpleScalar framework.",

      "context": "Transactional Memory (TM), Thread-Level Speculation (TLS), and Checkpointed multiprocessors are three popular architectural techniques based on the execution of multiple, cooperating speculative threads. In these environments, correctly maintaining data dependences across threads requires mechanisms for disambiguating addresses across threads, invalidating stale cache state, and making committed state visible. These mechanisms are both conceptually involved and hard to implement. In this paper, we present Bulk, a novel approach to simplify these mechanisms. The idea is to hash-encode a thread\u2019s access information in a concise signature, and then support in hardware signature operations that efficiently process sets of addresses. Such operations implement the mechanisms described. Bulk operations are inexact but correct, and provide substantial conceptual and implementation simplicity. We evaluate Bulk in the context of TLS using SPECint2000 codes and TM using multithreaded Java workloads. Despite its simplicity, Bulk has competitive performance with more complex schemes. We also find that signature configuration is a key design parameter.",

This paper presents a simulation-based performance study of a representative group, each evaluated in a small system organization. These small-system organizations correspond to workstation-class computers and use on the order of 10 DRAM chips. The study covers Fast Page Mode, Extended Data Out, Synchronous, Enhanced Synchronous, Synchronous Link, Rambus, and Direct Rambus designs. Our simulations reveal several things: (a) current advanced DRAM technologies are attacking the memory bandwidth problem but not the latency problem; (b) bus transmission speed will soon become a primary factor limiting memory-system performance; (c) the post-L2 address stream still contains significant locality, though it varies from application to application; and (d) as we move to wider buses, row access time becomes more prominent, making it important to investigate techniques to exploit the available locality to decrease access time.",

      "authors": "Satish Narayanasamy, Gilles Pokam, and Brad Calder",
      "context": "Significant time is spent by companies trying to reproduce and fix the bugs that occur for released code. To assist developers, we propose the BugNet architecture to continuously record information on production runs. The information collected before the crash of a program can be used by the developers working in their execution environment to deterministically replay the last several million instructions executed before the crash. BugNet is based on the insight that recording the register file contents at any point in time, and then recording the load values that occur after that point can enable deterministic replaying of a program's execution. BugNet focuses on being able to replay the application's execution and the libraries it uses, but not the operating system. But our approach provides the ability to replay an application's execution across context switches and interrupts. Hence, BugNet obviates the need for tracking program I/O, interrupts and DMA transfers, which would have otherwise required more complex hardware support. In addition, BugNet does not require a final core dump of the system state for replaying, which significantly reduces the amount of data that must be sent back to the developer.",

      "title": "Focusing processor policies via critical-path prediction",
      "answer": "C",
      "authors": "Brian Fields, Shai Rubin, and Rastislav Bod\u00edk",
      "context": "Although some instructions hurt performance more than others, current processors typically apply scheduling and speculation as if each instruction was equally costly. Instruction cost can be naturally expressed through the critical path: if we could predict it at run-time, egalitarian policies could be replaced with cost-sensitive strategies that will grow increasingly effective as processors become more parallel. This paper introduces a hardware predictor of instruction criticality and uses it to improve performance. The predictor is both effective and simple in its hardware implementation. The effectiveness at improving performance stems from using a dependence-graph model of the microarchitectural critical path that identifies execution bottlenecks by incorporating both data and machine-specific dependences. The simplicity stems from a token-passing algorithm that computes the critical path without actually building the dependence graph. By focusing processor policies on critical instructions, our predictor enables a large class of optimizations. It can (i) give priority to critical instructions for scarce resources (functional units, ports, predictor entries); and (ii) suppress speculation on non-critical instructions, thus reducing \u201cuseless\u201d misspeculations. We present two case studies that illustrate the potential of the two types of optimization, we show that (i) critical-path-based dynamic instruction scheduling and steering in a clustered architecture improves performance by as much as 21% (10% on average); and (ii) focusing value prediction only on critical instructions improves performance by as much as 5%, due to removing nearly half of the misspeculations.",

      "context": "Exponential growth in the number of on-chip transistors, coupled with reductions in voltage levels, makes each generation of microprocessors increasingly vulnerable to transient faults. In a multithreaded environment, we can detect these faults by running two copies of the same program as separate threads, feeding them identical inputs, and comparing their outputs, a technique we call Redundant Multithreading (RMT).This paper studies RMT techniques in the context of both single- and dual-processor simultaneous multithreaded (SMT) single-chip devices. Using a detailed, commercial-grade, SMT processor design we uncover subtle RMT implementation complexities, and find that RMT can be a more significant burden for single-processor devices than prior studies indicate. However, a novel application of RMT techniques in a dual-processor device, which we term chip-level redundant threading (CRT), shows higher performance than lockstepping the two cores, especially on multithreaded workloads.",

      "context": "Exponential growth in the number of on-chip transistors, coupled with reductions in voltage levels, makes each generation of microprocessors increasingly vulnerable to transient faults. In a multithreaded environment, we can detect these faults by running two copies of the same program as separate threads, feeding them identical inputs, and comparing their outputs, a technique we call Redundant Multithreading (RMT).This paper studies RMT techniques in the context of both single- and dual-processor simultaneous multithreaded (SMT) single-chip devices. Using a detailed, commercial-grade, SMT processor design we uncover subtle RMT implementation complexities, and find that RMT can be a more significant burden for single-processor devices than prior studies indicate. However, a novel application of RMT techniques in a dual-processor device, which we term chip-level redundant threading (CRT), shows higher performance than lockstepping the two cores, especially on multithreaded workloads.",
      "question": "As transistor density increases and voltage levels decrease, the susceptibility of microprocessors to transient faults ____, making fault tolerance techniques increasingly important.\nA) Remains constant as these factors offset each other.\nB) Increases, necessitating more robust mitigation strategies.\nC) Decreases due to advancements in manufacturing processes.\nD) Becomes irrelevant as error correction codes become more efficient.",

      "context": "In this paper, we consider tiled chip multiprocessors (CMP) where each tile contains a slice of the total on-chip L2 cache storage and tiles are connected by an on-chip network. The L2 slices can be managed using two basic schemes: 1) each slice is treated as a private L2 cache for the tile; 2) all slices are treated as a single large L2 cache shared by all tiles. Private L2 caches provide the lowest hit latency but reduce the total effective cache capacity, as each tile creates local copies of any line it touches. A shared L2 cache increases the effective cache capacity for shared data, but incurs long hit latencies when L2 data is on a remote tile. We present a new cache management policy, victim replication, which combines the advantages of private and shared schemes. Victim replication is a variant of the shared scheme which attempts to keep copies of local primary cache victims within the local L2 cache slice. Hits to these replicated copies reduce the effective latency of the shared L2 cache, while retaining the benefits of a higher effective capacity for shared data. We evaluate the various schemes using full-system simulation of both single-threaded and multi-threaded benchmarks running on an 8-processor tiled CMP. We show that victim replication reduces the average memory access latency of the shared L2 cache by an average of 16% for multi-threaded benchmarks and 24% for single-threaded benchmarks, providing better overall performance than either private or shared schemes.",

      "authors": "Kriszti\u00e1n Flautner, Nam Sung Kim, Steve Martin, David Blaauw, and Trevor Mudge",
      "context": "On-chip caches represent a sizable fraction of the total power consumption of microprocessors. Although large caches can significantly improve performance, they have the potential to increase power consumption. As feature sizes shrink, the dominant component of this power loss will be leakage. However, during a fixed period of time the activity in a cache is only centered on a small subset of the lines. This behavior can be exploited to cut the leakage power of large caches by putting the cold cache lines into a state preserving, low-power drowsy mode. Moving lines into and out of drowsy state incurs a slight performance loss. In this paper we investigate policies and circuit techniques for implementing drowsy caches. We show that with simple architectural techniques, about 80%-90% of the cache lines can be maintained in a drowsy state without affecting performance by more than 1%. According to our projections, in a 0.07um CMOS process, drowsy caches will be able to reduce the total energy (static and dynamic) consumed in the caches by 50%-75%. We also argue that the use of drowsy caches can simplify the design and control of low-leakage caches, and avoid the need to completely turn off selected cache lines and lose their state.",

      "context": "To address the increasing susceptibility of commodity chip multiprocessors (CMPs) to transient faults, we propose Chiplevel Redundantly Threaded multiprocessor with Recovery (CRTR). CRTR extends the previously-proposed CRT for transient-fault detection in CMPs, and the previously-proposed SRTR for transient-fault recovery in SMT. All these schemes achieve fault tolerance by executing and comparing two copies, called leading and trailing threads, of a given application. Previous recovery schemes for SMT do not perform well on CMPs. In a CMP, the leading and trailing threads execute on different processors to achieve load balancing and reduce the probability of a fault corrupting both threads; whereas in an SMT, both threads execute on the same processor. The inter-processor communication required to compare the threads introduces latency and bandwidth problems not present in an SMT.To hide inter-processor latency, CRTR executes the leading thread ahead of the trailing thread by maintaining a long slack, enabled by asymmetric commit. CRTR commits the leading thread before checking and the trailing thread after checking, so that the trailing thread state may be used for recovery. Previous recovery schemes commit both threads after checking, making a long slack suboptimal. To tackle inter-processor bandwidth, CRTR not only increases the bandwidth supply by pipelining the communication paths, but also reduces the bandwidth demand. By reasoning that faults propagate through dependences, previously-proposed Dependence-Based Checking Elision (DBCE) exploits (true) register dependence chains so that only the value of the last instruction in a chain is checked. However, instructions that mask operand bits may mask faults and limit the use of dependence chains. We propose Death- and Dependence-Based Checking Elision (DDBCE), which chains a masking instruction only if the source operand of the instruction dies after the instruction. Register deaths ensure that masked faults do not corrupt later computation. Using SPEC2000, we show that CRTR incurs negligible performance loss compared to CRT for inter-processor (one-way) latency as high as 30 cycles, and that the bandwidth requirements of CRT and CRTR with DDBCE are 5.2 and 7.1 bytes/cycle, respectively.",

      "context": "This paper evaluates the Raw microprocessor. Raw addresses thechallenge of building a general-purpose architecture that performswell on a larger class of stream and embedded computing applicationsthan existing microprocessors, while still running existingILP-based sequential programs with reasonable performance in theface of increasing wire delays. Raw approaches this challenge byimplementing plenty of on-chip resources - including logic, wires,and pins - in a tiled arrangement, and exposing them through a newISA, so that the software can take advantage of these resources forparallel applications. Raw supports both ILP and streams by routingoperands between architecturally-exposed functional units overa point-to-point scalar operand network. This network offers lowlatency for scalar data transport. Raw manages the effect of wiredelays by exposing the interconnect and using software to orchestrateboth scalar and stream data transport.We have implemented a prototype Raw microprocessor in IBM's180 nm, 6-layer copper, CMOS 7SF standard-cell ASIC process. Wehave also implemented ILP and stream compilers. Our evaluationattempts to determine the extent to which Raw succeeds in meetingits goal of serving as a more versatile, general-purpose processor.Central to achieving this goal is Raw's ability to exploit all formsof parallelism, including ILP, DLP, TLP, and Stream parallelism.Specifically, we evaluate the performance of Raw on a diverse setof codes including traditional sequential programs, streaming applications,server workloads and bit-level embedded computation.Our experimental methodology makes use of a cycle-accurate simulatorvalidated against our real hardware. Compared to a 180 nmPentium-III, using commodity PC memory system components, Rawperforms within a factor of 2x for sequential applications with a verylow degree of ILP, about 2x to 9x better for higher levels of ILP, and10x-100x better when highly parallel applications are coded in astream language or optimized by hand. The paper also proposes anew versatility metric and uses it to discuss the generality of Raw.",

      "context": "This paper evaluates the Raw microprocessor. Raw addresses thechallenge of building a general-purpose architecture that performswell on a larger class of stream and embedded computing applicationsthan existing microprocessors, while still running existingILP-based sequential programs with reasonable performance in theface of increasing wire delays. Raw approaches this challenge byimplementing plenty of on-chip resources - including logic, wires,and pins - in a tiled arrangement, and exposing them through a newISA, so that the software can take advantage of these resources forparallel applications. Raw supports both ILP and streams by routingoperands between architecturally-exposed functional units overa point-to-point scalar operand network. This network offers lowlatency for scalar data transport. Raw manages the effect of wiredelays by exposing the interconnect and using software to orchestrateboth scalar and stream data transport.We have implemented a prototype Raw microprocessor in IBM's180 nm, 6-layer copper, CMOS 7SF standard-cell ASIC process. Wehave also implemented ILP and stream compilers. Our evaluationattempts to determine the extent to which Raw succeeds in meetingits goal of serving as a more versatile, general-purpose processor.Central to achieving this goal is Raw's ability to exploit all formsof parallelism, including ILP, DLP, TLP, and Stream parallelism.Specifically, we evaluate the performance of Raw on a diverse setof codes including traditional sequential programs, streaming applications,server workloads and bit-level embedded computation.Our experimental methodology makes use of a cycle-accurate simulatorvalidated against our real hardware. Compared to a 180 nmPentium-III, using commodity PC memory system components, Rawperforms within a factor of 2x for sequential applications with a verylow degree of ILP, about 2x to 9x better for higher levels of ILP, and10x-100x better when highly parallel applications are coded in astream language or optimized by hand. The paper also proposes anew versatility metric and uses it to discuss the generality of Raw.",

This type of architecture covers a spectrum ofworkloads particularly well, providing high single-thread performancewhen thread parallelism is low, and high throughputwhen thread parallelism is high.This paper examines two such architectures in detail,demonstrating dynamic core assignment policies that providesignificant performance gains over naive assignment, andeven outperform the best static assignment.

TRIPS contains mechanisms that enable the processing cores and the on-chip memory system to be configured and combined in different modes for instruction, data, or thread-level parallelism. To adapt to small and large-grain concurrency, the TRIPS architecture contains four out-of-order, 16-wide-issue Grid Processor cores, which can be partitioned when easily extractable fine-grained parallelism exists. This approach to polymorphism provides better performance across a wide range of application types than an approach in which many small processors are aggregated to run workloads with irregular parallelism. Our results show that high performance can be obtained in each of the three modes--ILP, TLP, and DLP-demonstrating the viability of the polymorphous coarse-grained approach for future microprocessors.",

      "answer": "B",
      "authors": "Jayanth Srinivasan, Sarita V. Adve, Pradip Bose, Jude A. Rivers",
      "context": "Ensuring long processor lifetimes by limiting failuresdue to wear-out related hard errors is a critical requirementfor all microprocessor manufacturers. We observethat continuous device scaling and increasing temperaturesare making lifetime reliability targets even harder to meet.However, current methodologies for qualifying lifetime reliabilityare overly conservative since they assume worst-caseoperating conditions. This paper makes the case thatthe continued use of such methodologies will significantlyand unnecessarily constrain performance. Instead, lifetimereliability awareness at the microarchitectural design stagecan mitigate this problem, by designing processors that dynamicallyadapt in response to the observed usage to meeta reliability target.We make two specific contributions. First, we describean architecture-level model and its implementation, calledRAMP, that can dynamically track lifetime reliability, respondingto changes in application behavior. RAMP isbased on state-of-the-art device models for different wear-outmechanisms. Second, we propose dynamic reliabilitymanagement (DRM) - a technique where the processorcan respond to changing application behavior to maintainits lifetime reliability target. In contrast to currentworst-case behavior based reliability qualification methodologies,DRM allows processors to be qualified for reliabilityat lower (but more likely) operating points than theworst case. Using RAMP, we show that this can save costand/or improve performance, that dynamic voltage scalingis an effective response technique for DRM, and that dynamicthermal management neither subsumes nor is sub-sumedby DRM.",

      "context": "Debuggers have been proven indispensable in improving software reliability. Unfortunately, on most real-life software, debuggers fail to deliver their most essential feature --- a faithful replay of the execution. The reason is non-determinism caused by multithreading and non-repeatable inputs. A common solution to faithful replay has been to record the non-deterministic execution. Existing recorders, however, either work only for datarace-free programs or have prohibitive overhead.As a step towards powerful debugging, we develop a practical low-overhead hardware recorder for cachecoherent multiprocessors, called Flight Data Recorder (FDR). Like an aircraft flight data recorder, FDR continuously records the execution, even on deployed systems, logging the execution for post-mortem analysis.FDR is practical because it piggybacks on the cache coherence hardware and logs nearly the minimal threadordering information necessary to faithfully replay the multiprocessor execution. Our studies, based on simulating a four-processor server with commercial workloads, show that when allocated less than 7% of system's physical memory, our FDR design can capture the last one second of the execution at modest (less than 2%) slowdown.",

      "answer": "A",
      "authors": "Stefanos Kaxiras, Zhigang Hu, and Margaret Martonosi",
      "context": "Power dissipation is increasingly important in CPUs ranging from those intended for mobile use, all the way up to high performance processors for high-end servers. While the bulk of the power dissipated is dynamic switching power leakage power is also beginning to be a concern. Chipmakers expect that in future chip generations, leakage's proportion of total chip power will increase significantly. This paper examines methods for reducing leakage power within the cache memories of the CPU. Because caches comprise much of a CPU chip's area and transistor counts, they are reasonable targets for attacking leakage. We discuss policies and implementations for reducing cache leakage by invalidating and \"turning off\" cache lines when they hold data not likely to be reused. In particular our approach is targeted at the generational nature of cache line usage. That is, cache lines typically have a flurry of frequent use when first brought into the cache, and then have a period of \"dead time\" before they are evicted. By devising effective, low-power ways of deducing dead time, our results show that in many cases we can reduce Ll cache leakage energy by 4/spl times/ in SPEC2000 applications without impacting performance. Because our decay-based techniques have notions of competitive on-line algorithms at their roots, their energy usage can be theoretically bounded at within a factor of two of the optimal oracle-based policy. We also examine adaptive decay-based policies that make energy-minimizing policy choices on a per-application basis by choosing appropriate decay intervals individually, for each cache line. Our proposed adaptive policies effectively reduce Ll cache leakage energy by 5/spl times/ for the SPEC2000 with only negligible degradations in performance.",

      "context": "Power dissipation is increasingly important in CPUs ranging from those intended for mobile use, all the way up to high performance processors for high-end servers. While the bulk of the power dissipated is dynamic switching power leakage power is also beginning to be a concern. Chipmakers expect that in future chip generations, leakage's proportion of total chip power will increase significantly. This paper examines methods for reducing leakage power within the cache memories of the CPU. Because caches comprise much of a CPU chip's area and transistor counts, they are reasonable targets for attacking leakage. We discuss policies and implementations for reducing cache leakage by invalidating and \"turning off\" cache lines when they hold data not likely to be reused. In particular our approach is targeted at the generational nature of cache line usage. That is, cache lines typically have a flurry of frequent use when first brought into the cache, and then have a period of \"dead time\" before they are evicted. By devising effective, low-power ways of deducing dead time, our results show that in many cases we can reduce Ll cache leakage energy by 4/spl times/ in SPEC2000 applications without impacting performance. Because our decay-based techniques have notions of competitive on-line algorithms at their roots, their energy usage can be theoretically bounded at within a factor of two of the optimal oracle-based policy. We also examine adaptive decay-based policies that make energy-minimizing policy choices on a per-application basis by choosing appropriate decay intervals individually, for each cache line. Our proposed adaptive policies effectively reduce Ll cache leakage energy by 5/spl times/ for the SPEC2000 with only negligible degradations in performance.",

      "authors": "Stuart Schechter, Gabriel H. Loh, Karin Strauss, and Doug Burger",
      "context": "As leakage and other charge storage limitations begin to impair the scalability of DRAM, non-volatile resistive memories are being developed as a potential replacement. Unfortunately, current error correction techniques are poorly suited to this emerging class of memory technologies. Unlike DRAM, PCM and other resistive memories have wear lifetimes, measured in writes, that are sufficiently short to make cell failures common during a system's lifetime. However, resistive memories are much less susceptible to transient faults than DRAM. The Hamming-based ECC codes used in DRAM are designed to handle transient faults with no effective lifetime limits, but ECC codes applied to resistive memories would wear out faster than the cells they are designed to repair. This paper evaluates Error-Correcting Pointers (ECP), a new approach to error correction optimized for memories in which errors are the result of permanent cell failures that occur, and are immediately detectable, at write time. ECP corrects errors by permanently encoding the locations of failed cells into a table and assigning cells to replace them. ECP provides longer lifetimes than previously proposed solutions with equivalent overhead. What's more, as the level of variance in cell lifetimes increases -- a likely consequence of further scalaing -- ECP's margin of improvement over existing schemes increases.",

It provides a single execution model across all configurations, requires no additional programming effort or specialized compiler support, maintains ISA compatibility, and leverages mature micro-architecture technology.",

      "context": "Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) offer avenues to treat neurological disorders, shed light on brain function, and interface the brain with the digital world. Their wider adoption rests, however, on achieving adequate real-time performance, meeting stringent power constraints, and adhering to FDA-mandated safety requirements for chronic implantation. BCIs have, to date, been designed as custom ASICs for specific diseases or for specific tasks in specific brain regions. General-purpose architectures that can be used to treat multiple diseases and enable various computational tasks are needed for wider BCI adoption, but the conventional wisdom is that such systems cannot meet necessary performance and power constraints. We present HALO (Hardware Architecture for LOw-power BCIs), a general-purpose architecture for implantable BCIs. HALO enables tasks such as treatment of disorders (e.g., epilepsy, movement disorders), and records/processes data for studies that advance our understanding of the brain. We use electrophysiological data from the motor cortex of a non-human primate to determine how to decompose HALO's computational capabilities into hardware building blocks. We simplify, prune, and share these building blocks to judiciously use available hardware resources while enabling many modes of brain-computer interaction. The result is a configurable heterogeneous array of hardware processing elements (PEs). The PEs are configured by a low-power RISC-V micro-controller into signal processing pipelines that meet the target performance and power constraints necessary to deploy HALO widely and safely.",

      "answer": "D",
      "authors": "Ashley Saulsbury, Fong Pong, Andreas Nowatzyk",
      "context": "Current high performance computer systems use complex, large superscalar CPUs that interface to the main memory through a hierarchy of caches and interconnect systems. These CPU-centric designs invest a lot of power and chip area to bridge the widening gap between CPU and main memory speeds. Yet, many large applications do not operate well on these systems and are limited by the memory subsystem performance.This paper argues for an integrated system approach that uses less-powerful CPUs that are tightly integrated with advanced memory technologies to build competitive systems with greatly reduced cost and complexity. Based on a design study using the next generation 0.25&micro;m, 256Mbit dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) process and on the analysis of existing machines, we show that processor memory integration can be used to build competitive, scalable and cost-effective MP systems.We present results from execution driven uni- and multi-processor simulations showing that the benefits of lower latency and higher bandwidth can compensate for the restrictions on the size and complexity of the integrated processor. In this system, small direct mapped instruction caches with long lines are very effective, as are column buffer data caches augmented with a victim cache.",
      "question": "When memory latency is significantly reduced, which of the following cache design strategies becomes more effective?\nA) Large, highly associative caches with short cache lines.\nB) Complex prefetching mechanisms coupled with large, set-associative caches.\nC) Multi-level cache hierarchies with inclusive policies.\nD) Small, direct-mapped caches with long cache lines.",

      "context": "Processing-in-memory (PIM) is a promising solution to address the \"memory wall\" challenges for future computer systems. Prior proposed PIM architectures put additional computation logic in or near memory. The emerging metal-oxide resistive random access memory (ReRAM) has showed its potential to be used for main memory. Moreover, with its crossbar array structure, ReRAM can perform matrix-vector multiplication efficiently, and has been widely studied to accelerate neural network (NN) applications. In this work, we propose a novel PIM architecture, called PRIME, to accelerate NN applications in ReRAM based main memory. In PRIME, a portion of ReRAM crossbar arrays can be configured as accelerators for NN applications or as normal memory for a larger memory space. We provide microarchitecture and circuit designs to enable the morphable functions with an insignificant area overhead. We also design a software/hardware interface for software developers to implement various NNs on PRIME. Benefiting from both the PIM architecture and the efficiency of using ReRAM for NN computation, PRIME distinguishes itself from prior work on NN acceleration, with significant performance improvement and energy saving. Our experimental results show that, compared with a state-of-the-art neural processing unit design, PRIME improves the performance by ~2360x and the energy consumption by ~895x, across the evaluated machine learning benchmarks.",

      "context": "Memory isolation is a key property of a reliable and secure computing system--an access to one memory address should not have unintended side effects on data stored in other addresses. However, as DRAM process technology scales down to smaller dimensions, it becomes more difficult to prevent DRAM cells from electrically interacting with each other. In this paper, we expose the vulnerability of commodity DRAM chips to disturbance errors. By reading from the same address in DRAM, we show that it is possible to corrupt data in nearby addresses. More specifically, activating the same row in DRAM corrupts data in nearby rows. We demonstrate this phenomenon on Intel and AMD systems using a malicious program that generates many DRAM accesses. We induce errors in most DRAM modules (110 out of 129) from three major DRAM manufacturers. From this we conclude that many deployed systems are likely to be at risk. We identify the root cause of disturbance errors as the repeated toggling of a DRAM row's wordline, which stresses inter-cell coupling effects that accelerate charge leakage from nearby rows. We provide an extensive characterization study of disturbance errors and their behavior using an FPGA-based testing platform. Among our key findings, we show that (i) it takes as few as 139K accesses to induce an error and (ii) up to one in every 1.7K cells is susceptible to errors. After examining various potential ways of addressing the problem, we propose a low-overhead solution to prevent the errors",

      "context": "The ability to perform long, accurate molecular dynamics (MD) simulations involving proteins and other biological macro-molecules could in principle provide answers to some of the most important currently outstanding questions in the fields of biology, chemistry and medicine. A wide range of biologically interesting phenomena, however, occur over time scales on the order of a millisecond--about three orders of magnitude beyond the duration of the longest current MD simulations. In this paper, we describe a massively parallel machine called Anton, which should be capable of executing millisecond-scale classical MD simulations of such biomolecular systems. The machine, which is scheduled for completion by the end of 2008, is based on 512 identical MD-specific ASICs that interact in a tightly coupled manner using a specialized high-speed communication network. Anton has been designed to use both novel parallel algorithms and special-purpose logic to dramatically accelerate those calculations that dominate the time required for a typical MD simulation. The remainder of the simulation algorithm is executed by a programmable portion of each chip that achieves a substantial degree of parallelism while preserving the flexibility necessary to accommodate anticipated advances in physical models and simulation methods.",

      "context": "The ability to perform long, accurate molecular dynamics (MD) simulations involving proteins and other biological macro-molecules could in principle provide answers to some of the most important currently outstanding questions in the fields of biology, chemistry and medicine. A wide range of biologically interesting phenomena, however, occur over time scales on the order of a millisecond--about three orders of magnitude beyond the duration of the longest current MD simulations. In this paper, we describe a massively parallel machine called Anton, which should be capable of executing millisecond-scale classical MD simulations of such biomolecular systems. The machine, which is scheduled for completion by the end of 2008, is based on 512 identical MD-specific ASICs that interact in a tightly coupled manner using a specialized high-speed communication network. Anton has been designed to use both novel parallel algorithms and special-purpose logic to dramatically accelerate those calculations that dominate the time required for a typical MD simulation. The remainder of the simulation algorithm is executed by a programmable portion of each chip that achieves a substantial degree of parallelism while preserving the flexibility necessary to accommodate anticipated advances in physical models and simulation methods.",

      "context": "Due to their high volume, general-purpose processors, and now chip multiprocessors (CMPs), are much more cost effective than ASICs, but lag significantly in terms of performance and energy efficiency. This paper explores the sources of these performance and energy overheads in general-purpose processing systems by quantifying the overheads of a 720p HD H.264 encoder running on a general-purpose CMP system. It then explores methods to eliminate these overheads by transforming the CPU into a specialized system for H.264 encoding. We evaluate the gains from customizations useful to broad classes of algorithms, such as SIMD units, as well as those specific to particular computation, such as customized storage and functional units. The ASIC is 500x more energy efficient than our original four-processor CMP. Broadly applicable optimizations improve performance by 10x and energy by 7x. However, the very low energy costs of actual core ops (100s fJ in 90nm) mean that over 90% of the energy used in these solutions is still \"overhead\". Achieving ASIC-like performance and efficiency requires algorithm-specific optimizations. For each sub-algorithm of H.264, we create a large, specialized functional unit that is capable of executing 100s of operations per instruction. This improves performance and energy by an additional 25x and the final customized CMP matches an ASIC solution's performance within 3x of its energy and within comparable area.",

      "context": "Many architects believe that major improvements in cost-energy-performance must now come from domain-specific hardware. This paper evaluates a custom ASIC---called a Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) --- deployed in datacenters since 2015 that accelerates the inference phase of neural networks (NN). The heart of the TPU is a 65,536 8-bit MAC matrix multiply unit that offers a peak throughput of 92 TeraOps/second (TOPS) and a large (28 MiB) software-managed on-chip memory. The TPU's deterministic execution model is a better match to the 99th-percentile response-time requirement of our NN applications than are the time-varying optimizations of CPUs and GPUs that help average throughput more than guaranteed latency. The lack of such features helps explain why, despite having myriad MACs and a big memory, the TPU is relatively small and low power. We compare the TPU to a server-class Intel Haswell CPU and an Nvidia K80 GPU, which are contemporaries deployed in the same datacenters. Our workload, written in the high-level TensorFlow framework, uses production NN applications (MLPs, CNNs, and LSTMs) that represent 95% of our datacenters' NN inference demand. Despite low utilization for some applications, the TPU is on average about 15X -- 30X faster than its contemporary GPU or CPU, with TOPS/Watt about 30X -- 80X higher. Moreover, using the CPU's GDDR5 memory in the TPU would triple achieved TOPS and raise TOPS/Watt to nearly 70X the GPU and 200X the CPU.",

      "context": "Simultaneous multithreading is a technique that permits multiple independent threads to issue multiple instructions each cycle. In previous work we demonstrated the performance potential of simultaneous multithreading, based on a somewhat idealized model. In this paper we show that the throughput gains from simultaneous multithreading can be achieved without extensive changes to a conventional wide-issue superscalar, either in hardware structures or sizes. We present an architecture for simultaneous multithreading that achieves three goals: (1) it minimizes the architectural impact on the conventional superscalar design, (2) it has minimal performance impact on a single thread executing alone, and (3) it achieves significant throughput gains when running multiple threads. Our simultaneous multithreading architecture achieves a throughput of 5.4 instructions per cycle, a 2.5-fold improvement over an unmodified superscalar with similar hardware resources. This speedup is enhanced by an advantage of multithreading previously unexploited in other architectures: the ability to favor for fetch and issue those threads most efficiently using the processor each cycle, thereby providing the \"best\" instructions to the processor.",

      "context": "This paper makes the case that pin bandwidth will be a critical consideration for future microprocessors. We show that many of the techniques used to tolerate growing memory latencies do so at the expense of increased bandwidth requirements. Using a decomposition of execution time, we show that for modern processors that employ aggressive memory latency tolerance techniques, wasted cycles due to insufficient bandwidth generally exceed those due to raw memory latencies. Given the importance of maximizing memory bandwidth, we calculate effective pin bandwidth, then estimate optimal effective pin bandwidth. We measure these quantities by determining the amount by which both caches and minimal-traffic caches filter accesses to the lower levels of the memory hierarchy. We see that there is a gap that can exceed two orders of magnitude between the total memory traffic generated by caches and the minimal-traffic caches---implying that the potential exists to increase effective pin bandwidth substantially. We decompose this traffic gap into four factors, and show they contribute quite differently to traffic reduction for different benchmarks. We conclude that, in the short term, pin bandwidth limitations will make more complex on-chip caches cost-effective. For example, flexible caches may allow individual applications to choose from a range of caching policies. In the long term, we predict that off-chip accesses will be so expensive that all system memory will reside on one or more processor chips.",

      "answer": "C",
      "authors": "James Donald and Margaret Martonosi",
      "context": "Power density continues to increase exponentially with each new technology generation, posing a major challenge for thermal management in modern processors. Much past work has examined microarchitectural policies for reducing total chip power, but these techniques alone are insufficient if not aimed at mitigating individual hotspots. The industry's trend has been toward multicore architectures, which provide additional opportunities for dynamic thermal management. This paper explores various thermal management techniques that exploit the distributed nature of multicore processors. We classify these techniques in terms of core throttling policy, whether that policy is applied locally to a core or to the processor as a whole, and process migration policies. We use Turandot and a HotSpot-based thermal simulator to simulate a variety of workloads under thermal duress on a 4-core PowerPCtrade processor. Using benchmarks from the SPEC 2000 suite we characterize workloads in terms of instruction throughput as well as their effective duty cycles. Among a variety of options we find that distributed control-theoretic DVFS alone improves throughput by 2.5times under our test conditions. Our final design involves a PI-based core thermal controller and an outer control loop to decide process migrations. This policy avoids all thermal emergencies and yields an average of 2.6times speedup over the baseline across all workloads",
      "question": "A key advantage of distributed control-theoretic DVFS in multicore processors is the ability to ____ compared to baseline configurations.\nA) reduce energy consumption\nB) increase thermal emergencies\nC) improve throughput\nD) decrease complexity",

      "context": "As improvements in per-transistor speed and energy efficiency diminish, radical departures from conventional approaches are becoming critical to improving the performance and energy efficiency of general-purpose processors. We propose a solution--from circuit to compiler-that enables general-purpose use of limited-precision, analog hardwareto accelerate \"approximable\" code---code that can tolerate imprecise execution. We utilize an algorithmic transformation that automatically converts approximable regions of code from a von Neumann model to an \"analog\" neural model. We outline the challenges of taking an analog approach, including restricted-range value encoding, limited precision in computation, circuit inaccuracies, noise, and constraints on supported topologies. We address these limitations with a combination of circuit techniques, a hardware/software interface, neuralnetwork training techniques, and compiler support. Analog neural acceleration provides whole application speedup of 3.7x and energy savings of 6.3x with quality loss less than 10% for all except one benchmark. These results show that using limited-precision analog circuits for code acceleration, through a neural approach, is both feasible and beneficial over a range of approximation-tolerant, emerging applications including financial analysis, signal processing, robotics, 3D gaming, compression, and image processing",

      "context": "Software cache-based side channel attacks are a serious new class of threats for computers. Unlike physical side channel attacks that mostly target embedded cryptographic devices, cache-based side channel attacks can also undermine general purpose systems. The attacks are easy to perform, effective on most platforms, and do not require special instruments or excessive computation power. In recently demonstrated attacks on software implementations of ciphers like AES and RSA, the full key can be recovered by an unprivileged user program performing simple timing measurements based on cache misses. We first analyze these attacks, identifying cache interference as the root cause of these attacks. We identify two basic mitigation approaches: the partition-based approach eliminates cache interference whereas the randomization-based approach randomizes cache interference so that zero information can be inferred. We present new security-aware cache designs, the Partition-Locked cache (PLcache) and Random Permutation cache (RPcache), analyze and prove their security, and evaluate their performance. Our results show that our new cache designs with built-in security can defend against cache-based side channel attacks in general-rather than only specific attacks on a given cryptographic algorithm-with very little performance degradation and hardware cost.",

Unlike physical side channel attacks that mostly target embedded cryptographic devices, cache-based side channel attacks can also undermine general purpose systems. The attacks are easy to perform, effective on most platforms, and do not require special instruments or excessive computation power. In recently demonstrated attacks on software implementations of ciphers like AES and RSA, the full key can be recovered by an unprivileged user program performing simple timing measurements based on cache misses. We first analyze these attacks, identifying cache interference as the root cause of these attacks. We identify two basic mitigation approaches: the partition-based approach eliminates cache interference whereas the randomization-based approach randomizes cache interference so that zero information can be inferred. We present new security-aware cache designs, the Partition-Locked cache (PLcache) and Random Permutation cache (RPcache), analyze and prove their security, and evaluate their performance. Our results show that our new cache designs with built-in security can defend against cache-based side channel attacks in general-rather than only specific attacks on a given cryptographic algorithm-with very little performance degradation and hardware cost.",

      "context": "We expect that many-core microprocessors will push performance per chip from the 10 gigaflop to the 10 teraflop range in the coming decade. To support this increased performance, memory and inter-core bandwidths will also have to scale by orders of magnitude. Pin limitations, the energy cost of electrical signaling, and the non-scalability of chip-length global wires are significant bandwidth impediments. Recent developments in silicon nanophotonic technology have the potential to meet these off- and on-stack bandwidth requirements at acceptable power levels. Corona is a 3 D many-core architecture that uses nanophotonic communication for both inter-core communication and off-stack communication to memory or I/O devices. Its peak floating-point performance is 10 teraflops. Dense wavelength division multiplexed optically connected memory modules provide 10 terabyte per second memory bandwidth. A photonic crossbar fully interconnects its 256 low-power multithreaded cores at 20 terabyte per second bandwidth. We have simulated a 1024 thread Corona system running synthetic benchmarks and scaled versions of the SPLASH-2 benchmark suite. We believe that in comparison with an electrically-connected many-core alternative that uses the same on-stack interconnect power, Corona can provide 2 to 6 times more performance on many memory intensive workloads, while simultaneously reducing power.",

      "context": "The performance tradeoff between hardware complexity and clock speed is studied. First, a generic superscalar pipeline is defined. Then the specific areas of register renaming, instruction window wakeup and selection logic, and operand bypassing are analyzed. Each is modeled and Spice simulated for feature sizes of 0.8&micro;m, 0.35&micro;m, and 0.18&micro;m. Performance results and trends are expressed in terms of issue width and window size. Our analysis indicates that window wakeup and selection logic as well as operand bypass logic are likely to be the most critical in the future.A microarchitecture that simplifies wakeup and selection logic is proposed and discussed. This implementation puts chains of dependent instructions into queues, and issues instructions from multiple queues in parallel. Simulation shows little slowdown as compared with a completely flexible issue window when performance is measured in clock cycles. Furthermore, because only instructions at queue heads need to be awakened and selected, issue logic is simplified and the clock cycle is faster --- consequently overall performance is improved. By grouping dependent instructions together, the proposed microarchitecture will help minimize performance degradation due to slow bypasses in future wide-issue machines.",

      "context": "Conflict-based cache attacks can allow an adversary to infer the access pattern of a co-running application by orchestrating evictions via cache conflicts. Such attacks can be mitigated by randomizing the location of the lines in the cache. Our recent proposal, CEASER, makes cache randomization practical by accessing the cache using an encrypted address and periodically changing the encryption key. CEASER was analyzed with the state-of-the-art algorithm on forming eviction sets, and the analysis showed that CEASER with a Remap-Rate of 1% is sufficient to tolerate years of attack. In this paper, we present two new attacks that significantly push the state-of-the-art in forming eviction sets. Our first attack reduces the time required to form the eviction set from O(L2) to O(L), where L is the number of lines in the attack. This attack is 35x faster than the best-known attack and requires that the Remap-Rate of CEASER be increased to 35%. Our second attack exploits the replacement policy (we analyze LRU, RRIP, and Random) to form eviction set quickly and requires that the Remap-Rate of CEASER be increased to more than 100%, incurring impractical overheads. To improve the robustness of CEASER against these attacks in a practical manner, we propose Skewed-CEASER (CEASER-S), which divides the cache ways into multiple partitions and maps the cache line to be resident in a different set in each partition. This design significantly improves the robustness of CEASER, as the attacker must form an eviction set that can dislodge the line from multiple possible locations. We show that CEASER-S can tolerate years of attacks while retaining a Remap-Rate of 1%. CEASER-S incurs negligible slowdown (within 1%) and a storage overhead of less than 100 bytes for the newly added structures.",

      "context": "State-of-the-art deep neural networks (DNNs) have hundreds of millions of connections and are both computationally and memory intensive, making them difficult to deploy on embedded systems with limited hardware resources and power budgets. While custom hardware helps the computation, fetching weights from DRAM is two orders of magnitude more expensive than ALU operations, and dominates the required power. Previously proposed 'Deep Compression' makes it possible to fit large DNNs (AlexNet and VGGNet) fully in on-chip SRAM. This compression is achieved by pruning the redundant connections and having multiple connections share the same weight. We propose an energy efficient inference engine (EIE) that performs inference on this compressed network model and accelerates the resulting sparse matrix-vector multiplication with weight sharing. Going from DRAM to SRAM gives EIE 120x energy saving, Exploiting sparsity saves 10x, Weight sharing gives 8x, Skipping zero activations from ReLU saves another 3x. Evaluated on nine DNN benchmarks, EIE is 189x and 13x faster when compared to CPU and GPU implementations of the same DNN without compression. EIE has a processing power of 102 GOPS working directly on a compressed network, corresponding to 3 TOPS on an uncompressed network, and processes FC layers of AlexNet at 1.88x104 frames/sec with a power dissipation of only 600mW. It is 24,000x and 3,400x more energy efficient than a CPU and GPU respectively. Compared with DaDianNao, EIE has 2.9x, 19x and 3x better throughput, energy efficiency and area efficiency.",

      "authors": "Abhishek Bhattacharjee and Margaret Martonosi",
      "context": "With the shift towards chip multiprocessors (CMPs), exploiting and managing parallelism has become a central problem in computing systems. Many issues of parallelism management boil down to discerning which running threads or processes are critical, or slowest, versus which are non-critical. If one can accurately predict critical threads in a parallel program, then one can respond in a variety of ways. Possibilities include running the critical thread at a faster clock rate, performing load balancing techniques to offload work onto currently non-critical threads, or giving the critical thread more on-chip resources to execute faster. This paper proposes and evaluates simple but effective thread criticality predictors for parallel applications. We show that accurate predictors can be built using counters that are typically already available on-chip. Our predictor, based on memory hierarchy statistics, identifies thread criticality with an average accuracy of 93% across a range of architectures. We also demonstrate two applications of our predictor. First, we show how Intel's Threading Building Blocks (TBB) parallel runtime system can benefit from task stealing techniques that use our criticality predictor to reduce load imbalance. Using criticality prediction to guide TBB's task-stealing decisions improves performance by 13-32% for TBB-based PARSEC benchmarks running on a 32-core CMP. As a second application, criticality prediction guides dynamic energy optimizations in barrier-based applications. By running the predicted critical thread at the full clock rate and frequency-scaling non-critical threads, this approach achieves average energy savings of 15% while negligibly degrading performance for SPLASH-2 and PARSEC benchmarks.",

      "context": "The commonly used LRU replacement policy is susceptible to thrashing for memory-intensive workloads that have a working set greater than the available cache size. For such applications, the majority of lines traverse from the MRU position to the LRU position without receiving any cache hits, resulting in inefficient use of cache space. Cache performance can be improved if some fraction of the working set is retained in the cache so that at least that fraction of the working set can contribute to cache hits. We show that simple changes to the insertion policy can significantly reduce cache misses for memory-intensive workloads. We propose the LRU Insertion Policy (LIP) which places the incoming line in the LRU position instead of the MRU position. LIP protects the cache from thrashing and results in close to optimal hitrate for applications that have a cyclic reference pattern. We also propose the Bimodal Insertion Policy (BIP) as an enhancement of LIP that adapts to changes in the working set while maintaining the thrashing protection of LIP. We finally propose a Dynamic Insertion Policy (DIP) to choose between BIP and the traditional LRU policy depending on which policy incurs fewer misses. The proposed insertion policies do not require any change to the existing cache structure, are trivial to implement, and have a storage requirement of less than two bytes. We show that DIP reduces the average MPKI of the baseline 1MB 16-way L2 cache by 21%, bridging two-thirds of the gap between LRU and OPT.",

      "context": "We present FireSim, an open-source simulation platform that enables cycle-exact microarchitectural simulation of large scale-out clusters by combining FPGA-accelerated simulation of silicon-proven RTL designs with a scalable, distributed network simulation. Unlike prior FPGA-accelerated simulation tools, FireSim runs on Amazon EC2 F1, a public cloud FPGA platform, which greatly improves usability, provides elasticity, and lowers the cost of large-scale FPGA-based experiments. We describe the design and implementation of FireSim and show how it can provide sufficient performance to run modern applications at scale, to enable true hardware-software co-design. As an example, we demonstrate automatically generating and deploying a target cluster of 1,024 3.2 GHz quad-core server nodes, each with 16 GB of DRAM, interconnected by a 200 Gbit/s network with 2 microsecond latency, which simulates at a 3.4 MHz processor clock rate (less than 1,000x slowdown over real-time). In aggregate, this FireSim instantiation simulates 4,096 cores and 16 TB of memory, runs ~14 billion instructions per second, and harnesses 12.8 million dollars worth of FPGAs\u2014at a total cost of only ~$100 per simulation hour to the user. We present several examples to show how FireSim can be used to explore various research directions in warehouse-scale machine design, including modeling networks with high-bandwidth and low-latency, integrating arbitrary RTL designs for a variety of commodity and specialized datacenter nodes, and modeling a variety of datacenter organizations, as well as reusing the scale-out FireSim infrastructure to enable fast, massively parallel cycle-exact single-node microarchitectural experimentation.",

This prefetcher acts as an interface between the on-chip and off-chip cache, and can be added to existing computer designs. The Markov prefetcher is distinguished by prefetching multiple reference predictions from the memory subsystem, and then prioritizing the delivery of those references to the processor.This design results in a prefetching system that provides good coverage, is accurate and produces timely results that can be effectively used by the processor. In our cycle-level simulations, the Markov Prefetcher reduces the overall execution stalls due to instruction and data memory operations by an average of 54% for various commercial benchmarks while only using two thirds the memory of a demand-fetch cache organization.",

      "context": "Interactive AI-powered services require low-latency evaluation of deep neural network (DNN) models-aka \"\"real-time AI\"\". The growing demand for computationally expensive, state-of-the-art DNNs, coupled with diminishing performance gains of general-purpose architectures, has fueled an explosion of specialized Neural Processing Units (NPUs). NPUs for interactive services should satisfy two requirements: (1) execution of DNN models with low latency, high throughput, and high efficiency, and (2) flexibility to accommodate evolving state-of-the-art models (e.g., RNNs, CNNs, MLPs) without costly silicon updates. This paper describes the NPU architecture for Project Brainwave, a production-scale system for real-time AI. The Brainwave NPU achieves more than an order of magnitude improvement in latency and throughput over state-of-the-art GPUs on large RNNs at a batch size of 1. The NPU attains this performance using a single-threaded SIMD ISA paired with a distributed microarchitecture capable of dispatching over 7M operations from a single instruction. The spatially distributed microarchitecture, scaled up to 96,000 multiply-accumulate units, is supported by hierarchical instruction decoders and schedulers coupled with thousands of independently addressable high-bandwidth on-chip memories, and can transparently exploit many levels of fine-grain SIMD parallelism. When targeting an FPGA, microarchitectural parameters such as native datapaths and numerical precision can be \"synthesis specialized\" to models at compile time, enabling atypically high FPGA performance competitive with hardened NPUs. When running on an Intel Stratix 10 280 FPGA, the Brainwave NPU achieves performance ranging from ten to over thirty-five teraflops, with no batching, on large, memory-intensive RNNs.",

      "context": "Interactive AI-powered services require low-latency evaluation of deep neural network (DNN) models-aka \"\"real-time AI\"\". The growing demand for computationally expensive, state-of-the-art DNNs, coupled with diminishing performance gains of general-purpose architectures, has fueled an explosion of specialized Neural Processing Units (NPUs). NPUs for interactive services should satisfy two requirements: (1) execution of DNN models with low latency, high throughput, and high efficiency, and (2) flexibility to accommodate evolving state-of-the-art models (e.g., RNNs, CNNs, MLPs) without costly silicon updates. This paper describes the NPU architecture for Project Brainwave, a production-scale system for real-time AI. The Brainwave NPU achieves more than an order of magnitude improvement in latency and throughput over state-of-the-art GPUs on large RNNs at a batch size of 1. The NPU attains this performance using a single-threaded SIMD ISA paired with a distributed microarchitecture capable of dispatching over 7M operations from a single instruction. The spatially distributed microarchitecture, scaled up to 96,000 multiply-accumulate units, is supported by hierarchical instruction decoders and schedulers coupled with thousands of independently addressable high-bandwidth on-chip memories, and can transparently exploit many levels of fine-grain SIMD parallelism. When targeting an FPGA, microarchitectural parameters such as native datapaths and numerical precision can be \"synthesis specialized\" to models at compile time, enabling atypically high FPGA performance competitive with hardened NPUs. When running on an Intel Stratix 10 280 FPGA, the Brainwave NPU achieves performance ranging from ten to over thirty-five teraflops, with no batching, on large, memory-intensive RNNs.",

      "context": "Large-scale Internet services require a computing infrastructure that can beappropriately described as a warehouse-sized computing system. The cost ofbuilding datacenter facilities capable of delivering a given power capacity tosuch a computer can rival the recurring energy consumption costs themselves.Therefore, there are strong economic incentives to operate facilities as closeas possible to maximum capacity, so that the non-recurring facility costs canbe best amortized. That is difficult to achieve in practice because ofuncertainties in equipment power ratings and because power consumption tends tovary significantly with the actual computing activity. Effective powerprovisioning strategies are needed to determine how much computing equipmentcan be safely and efficiently hosted within a given power budget. In this paper we present the aggregate power usage characteristics of largecollections of servers (up to 15 thousand) for different classes ofapplications over a period of approximately six months. Those observationsallow us to evaluate opportunities for maximizing the use of the deployed powercapacity of datacenters, and assess the risks of over-subscribing it. We findthat even in well-tuned applications there is a noticeable gap (7 - 16%)between achieved and theoretical aggregate peak power usage at the clusterlevel (thousands of servers). The gap grows to almost 40% in wholedatacenters. This headroom can be used to deploy additional compute equipmentwithin the same power budget with minimal risk of exceeding it. We use ourmodeling framework to estimate the potential of power management schemes toreduce peak power and energy usage. We find that the opportunities for powerand energy savings are significant, but greater at the cluster-level (thousandsof servers) than at the rack-level (tens). Finally we argue that systems needto be power efficient across the activity range, and not only at peakperformance levels.",

This phenomenon implies that maximizing datacenter power utilization requires careful consideration of ____.\nA) solely the peak power ratings of individual servers.\nB) only the average power consumption of the entire datacenter.\nC) the actual workload-dependent power usage behavior of servers and the potential for over-subscription.\nD) minimizing the non-recurring facility costs.",

      "context": "Large-scale Internet services require a computing infrastructure that can beappropriately described as a warehouse-sized computing system. The cost ofbuilding datacenter facilities capable of delivering a given power capacity tosuch a computer can rival the recurring energy consumption costs themselves.Therefore, there are strong economic incentives to operate facilities as closeas possible to maximum capacity, so that the non-recurring facility costs canbe best amortized. That is difficult to achieve in practice because ofuncertainties in equipment power ratings and because power consumption tends tovary significantly with the actual computing activity. Effective powerprovisioning strategies are needed to determine how much computing equipmentcan be safely and efficiently hosted within a given power budget. In this paper we present the aggregate power usage characteristics of largecollections of servers (up to 15 thousand) for different classes ofapplications over a period of approximately six months. Those observationsallow us to evaluate opportunities for maximizing the use of the deployed powercapacity of datacenters, and assess the risks of over-subscribing it. We findthat even in well-tuned applications there is a noticeable gap (7 - 16%)between achieved and theoretical aggregate peak power usage at the clusterlevel (thousands of servers). The gap grows to almost 40% in wholedatacenters. This headroom can be used to deploy additional compute equipmentwithin the same power budget with minimal risk of exceeding it. We use ourmodeling framework to estimate the potential of power management schemes toreduce peak power and energy usage. We find that the opportunities for powerand energy savings are significant, but greater at the cluster-level (thousandsof servers) than at the rack-level (tens). Finally we argue that systems needto be power efficient across the activity range, and not only at peakperformance levels.",
